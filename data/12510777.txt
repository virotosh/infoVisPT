Chapter 1: Nothing is Impossible
Sherlock would never forget the night he was turned. If someone had told him he was going to become a monster before that night, he would brush them off. Before he was bitten, he didn't believe in any folklore or mythical creatures. They were supposed to be just that; 
.
He had been tailing his suspect when the man collapsed on the ground and started writhing. Rain poured down on London, but the man on the ground was oblivious to it. Sherlock suspected drugs, and he wasn't usually wrong. He waited for the convulsions to end, but froze as the form started to change and grow. Sherlock glanced around the abandoned alleyway to search for cameras. He found none. He was alone. John hadn't come back to 221B like he had planned. Sherlock hadn't accounted for John moving on after he had "died".
Low growls came from the form on the ground, followed by snuffling. Sherlock finally broke out of his trance and sprinted down the narrow alley. The 
 pounded after him, its hot breath ghosting down the back of his neck. Never in Sherlock's life had he been so 
 of anything. He now knew what a mouse felt right before a cat caught it and killed it. Sherlock was now prey to this ferocious beast; small and insignificant.
He was almost there; the end of the alleyway was within sight. Hope dared to rise in the detective as his feet slapped on the wet, dark concrete. Sherlock was wrong to hope as claws ripped down his back, pinning him on the ground. Sherlock shouted in agony, his whole world dissolving into white. And after large teeth sunk into his shoulder, his consciousness sunk into darkness.
