The consulting detective
Stood on the edge
With tears in his voice
"I'm a fake," he said.
"The newspapers were right
"Moriarty isn't real
"No one's that clever
"I'm not the real deal."
"It's all just a trick
"Some magic for you
"Now I'm leaving a note
"Isn't that what people do?"
He made his goodbye
Took a deep breath
Spread his arms wide
And fell to his death.
John screamed his name
As he watched his friend fall
Crashing onto the pavement
A sound heard by all.
The detective lay
In a pool of his blood
Eyes wide and staring
At the blue sky above.
No breath in his body
No pulse to be found
The detective was dead
When he hit the ground.
The great mind had fallen
And Moriarty was dead
John refused to believe
Sherlock was a fraud in the end.
 many words not spoken
So many lines unsaid
Regrets passed in silence
From living to dead.
The army doctor stood
By the grave of his friend
And asked for a miracle
"Don't be dead."
