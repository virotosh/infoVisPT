I hear a gentle foot step into the room. "They've made an arrest, Sherlock," Molly said.
"How could they have?" I answered. "How could they catch someone like him? There's no possible way that they could have captured a creature of such cunning and skill. He would have left no evidence behindâ€”he's too clever."
"What? What are you talking about?"
I turned to look at Molly, who had fresh tears brimming in her eyes. "What are you talking about?"
"The murder. They've arrested Mrs. Hudson."
Author's note: Welcome to the opening of my Sherlock/Frankenstein fusion! Let me know what you think of it. I do have the entire work drafted, so there will be entire story posted, never fear.
I don't own Sherlock or it's characters, and the Frankenstein fusion aspects are inspired by Mary Shelley's 
and Danny Boyle's stage adaptation of the same- and I don't own those either.
