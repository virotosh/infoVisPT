 I think as I spot my old friend Mike in the park. I try and avoid him, but he calls my name.
"Jane? Jane Watson?" He calls after me. I can't do anything but turn and acknowledge him. "I thought you were abroad, getting shot at. What happened?"
"I got shot," I say shortly, annoyed.
"Oh." A few minutes later, and we're sipping coffee on a bench.
"So, are you staying in town until you get sorted out?" He asks, looking over to me.
"You know I can't afford London on an army pension." He stays silent for a minute.
"You could ask Harry for help."
"Yeah, cause that's a fantastic idea," I say sarcastically. "You know we don't get along."
"You could find a flatmate?" He suggests again.
"Who would want me for a flatmate?" He just smiles.
"You know, you're the second person to say that to me today." I look to him in confusion.
"Who was the first?"
