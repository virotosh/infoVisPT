The Duchess and the Detective
Prologue: Molly Hooper plots
Three years. THREE YEARS! I cannot believe I have sat here pining for this stupid man for three whole years and he still hasn't noticed. I've tried lipstick, dates, coffee, even getting a new boyfriend, but nothing seems to work. The great Sherlock Holmes is impervious to my feminine charms.
But, do you know what? I'm tired of this. Tired of him underestimating me as Lestrade looks on in pity. He might not pay attention to me, but he'll pay attention to her. I never thought I'd have to bring her into the real world, and maybe I should have done this a long time ago, but tonight it ends. Sherlock Holmes, prepare to meet the real Molly Hooper.
