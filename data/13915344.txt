I once knew a pirate
He got lost at sea
The East Wind blew him away
Far out on the sea
Away from land
Safe havens gone
Out into upset waters
I thought I lost him to the ocean
But one day he returned
He somehow kept his head above water
Though it tried to drown him
And sirens tried to drag him down
But he kept fighting
And one day he returned
But he was no longer my little pirate
Nor longer the boy I knew
He was now a man
A man who been through hell
From drugs and falls; to deaths and lose
And somehow though it all he still managed to love
Just not me
