Many of Molly's phrases during the four seasons of Sherlock have stayed in our minds and this week they will be used as inspiration for the works in the Sherlolly fandom. My idea: use each of these phrases in the fanfics in different contexts from what happened in the series and, instead of Molly, this time it will be Sherlock saying each one with no changes on the original phrase.
I hope you all enjoy it. I loved exploring various scenarios and possibilities for the couple. The stories I will post this week are unrelated to each other and have no direct connection with my long fanfic.
Six of the fanfics are set after the end of season four. Only the teenlock one is an AU set in Molly and Sherlock's teenage years.
