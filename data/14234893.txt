-Sherlock's POV-
Sherlock Holmes stared at the class in front of him, contemplating the best approach to his new undercover role. Disguised as Professor Holmer, he had infiltrated the university, investigating a human trafficking racket masquerading within its walls. His true identity concealed, Sherlock prepared to navigate the intricate web of lies and deceit that awaited him.
Sherlock didn't know what to expect. He wasn't exactly the most child friendly person, well not children in this case but still students! The thought itself scared him quite a bit. He had only ever spoken to anyone who was not John or Mrs. Hudson or Lestrade or Microft to deduce them or gather information from them or well find some utility for them in general. How was he supposed to educate these "people"? However, Microft had called him for over a month insisting he take up this case, and this seemed like a better alternative to being bugged out of his mind by his brother.
As the chatter of the students finally subsided, Sherlock turned his gaze towards the class, forcing a smile onto his face. "Hello, everyone," he began, his voice projecting confidence. "Welcome to the cybersecurity class. In this course, we will explore the obscurities of the world wide web and its vulnerabilities. I must warn you, this will not be an easy class, and I do not expect all of you to persevere. But for those who do, I hope to impart knowledge that will deepen your understanding of cybersecurity. As for addressing me, you may call me Professor Holmer. Now, take out your laptops and begin taking notes."
Sherlock tell so much about all the fifteen students already, it was boring! At least they had a good mix of all nationalities. He had noted 7 britishers, one German girl, one from the Arabian countries, one Indian girl, one boy from Pakistan or India, one boy from France, one Netherlands, one Dutch boy and one girl and finally one American. Yes well quite an international cast.
"Let me set some rules before we start. Don't speak when I'm speaking. You may address me as Professor Holmer like I said. Raise your hand if you have a question. Try to keep the number of stupid questions to a minimum. I don't enjoy wasting time on explaining the self-explanatory. If you're late, don't bore me with excuses. You are doing your masters and not in kindergarten so do not expect me to coddle you. "
The room was abuzz with anticipation, a palpable energy radiating from the students who were keen to learn from the enigmatic figure standing before them. Sherlock cleared his throat, commanding attention, and began his lecture with a mixture of confidence and precision.
His voice resonated with authority as he delved into the intricacies of cybersecurity, unraveling the complex web of digital vulnerabilities that plagued society. Sherlock's unique approach to teaching captivated the students, his words painting vivid images of the invisible battles fought within the digital realm.
He began by emphasizing the importance of understanding human behavior and motivations, highlighting how cybercriminals exploited psychological weaknesses to gain access to sensitive information. Sherlock's sharp wit and razor-sharp observations drew parallels between criminal behavior in the physical world and the digital landscape, sparking a newfound appreciation for the intricacies of the subject matter.
With each passing moment, Sherlock's passion for the subject became evident. He effortlessly intertwined real-life cases and anecdotes, weaving together a narrative that showcased the gravity of cybersecurity threats. The students hung onto his every word, their eyes wide with intrigue as they absorbed the knowledge being imparted by the master detective.
Sherlock's teaching style was as unique as his investigative methods. He encouraged active participation, challenging the students to question assumptions and think critically. He welcomed debates, relishing in the opportunity to engage in intellectual sparring with the eager minds before him. His sharp retorts and quick wit kept the class on their toes, ensuring they were fully immersed in the subject matter.
Despite his aloof demeanor, Sherlock exhibited a surprising knack for fostering a supportive learning environment. He took the time to address each student individually, encouraging their thoughts and pushing them to explore uncharted territories within the field of cybersecurity. He inspired a sense of confidence, instilling in his students the belief that they too had the potential to become masters of their craft.
As the class progressed, Sherlock seamlessly incorporated practical exercises and simulations to reinforce theoretical concepts. He challenged his students to think like hackers, to understand their methodologies, and to anticipate their next moves. The lecture hall transformed into a hub of collective learning and discovery, with Sherlock as the guiding force leading them through the intricate maze of cybersecurity.
Time seemed to blur as Sherlock's passion for the subject grew infectious. The once skeptical students found themselves embracing the complexities of cybersecurity, their minds expanding with each passing lecture. Sherlock's unconventional teaching methods left a lasting impression, forever altering their perception of the digital landscape.
-General POV-
The general buzz of excitement filled the air as the students settled into their seats, their eyes fixed on the front of the classroom. They had heard rumors of a new professor joining their ranks, but nothing could have prepared them for the sight that greeted them. Standing before them was a young man, only a few years older than themselves, yet exuding an air of confidence and intelligence that was both captivating and surprising.
Whispers rippled through the room as the students exchanged glances of disbelief. "Did you see our new professor?" one student murmured to their friend. "He looks so young! I wasn't expecting that."
Another student chimed in, their curiosity piqued. "I wonder what his story is. How did someone his age become a professor?"
Professor Holmer possessed a striking and unforgettable appearance. His tall, lean frame exuded an air of intensity and purpose. With sharp, angular features, his face was a canvas for his profound intellect and unyielding determination.
Professor Holmer's most notable feature was his piercing, ice-blue eyes, which seemed to dissect the world around him with unwavering precision. They held a keen intelligence and a hint of mystery, capable of unsettling even the most composed individuals. His gaze was often focused, piercing through the facade of those he observed, searching for hidden truths and secrets.
His jet-black hair, styled in a disheveled yet deliberate manner, hinted at a mind consumed by relentless curiosity. Strands of unruly locks cascaded across his forehead, adding to his enigmatic charm. His sharp cheekbones accentuated the angular contours of his face, while his prominent jawline bore witness to his resolute nature. Professor Holmer 's complexion was pale, seemingly untouched by the sun's rays, as if his relentless pursuit of knowledge had kept him secluded from the outside world.
Professor Holmer's choice of attire reflected his disdain for societal norms and his preference for practicality. He had donned a tailored black coat, its sleek lines giving him an air of sophistication. Underneath, he wore a crisp white shirt and a dark-colored waistcoat, lending an element of timeless elegance to his enigmatic persona. His attire was completed with slim-fitting trousers and polished black shoes, allowing for ease of movement during his lecture.
In his movements, Professor Holmer possessed a fluid grace, gliding through the world with an almost ethereal presence. His gestures were precise, often accompanied by rapid-fire questions about the topic he was teaching and a sense of urgency as if he wanted to rip every thread of the web all at once to be laid bare for their inspection. He carried himself with a confident swagger, radiating an aura of self-assurance that commanded attention wherever he went.
Though his physical appearance was captivating, it was Professor Holmer's complex and enigmatic personality that truly enraptured the students. His sharp mind, keen intuition, and unwavering knowledge of his subject matter made him a force to be reckoned with. His outward appearance served as a mere vessel, disguising the intricate workings of a brilliant mind that constantly sought intellectual stimulation and the thrill of uncovering the truth.
In the eyes of the students who looked at him, Professor Holmer was an enigmaâ€”a captivating mix of brilliance, eccentricity, and a touch of madness. His appearance, much like his unparalleled intellect, left an indelible impression on all who sat entranced with his teachings.
In the midst of the buzz, Avanthika and Hassya, both international students, found themselves engaged in a conversation about their experiences at the university. Avanthika, hailing from India, listened attentively as Hassya, originally from Kuwait, expressed her fears about the challenging cybersecurity class they had just attended.
"I don't know if I can handle this," Hassya confessed, her voice tinged with apprehension. "The professor seems so strict and demanding. I'm afraid I'll fall behind."
Avanthika placed a reassuring hand on Hassya's arm, offering support. "Don't worry, Hassya. We're in this together, remember? If you ever need help or guidance, I'll be right there for you. We can navigate this journey side by side," she reassured her friend, her eyes filled with determination.
As Sherlock observed the students' reactions and contemplated his next move, he found himself craving the familiar presence of his loyal friend and confidant, John Watson. With a sense of longing, he reached for his phone and dialed John's number, hoping to hear his familiar voice and engage in a bit of "thinking out loud."
-Avanthika's POV-
Excitement coursed through Avanthika as she entered the classroom, accompanied by her friend Hassya. She had always been captivated by detective novels, and cybersecurity felt like her gateway into that world. However, her enthusiasm wavered as she observed the young and seemingly confident professor. His speech about the challenging nature of the class left her torn. While she understood the practicality of his words, the professor's insults and derogatory remarks towards the students felt unprofessional.
As the class ended, Avanthika's mind buzzed with the information the professor had shared. Glancing at Hassya, she noticed her friend's sickly expression, clearly overwhelmed by the subject matter. Determined to support her, Avanthika offered a comforting reassurance. "Don't worry, Hassya. We'll get through this. If the assignments are shared, we'll work together." However, her attempt to uplift her friend seemed to have little effect, as Hassya's color shifted from green to an even more concerning shade.
-Sherlock POV-
Finally the class had broken. He already felt exhausted with the amount of interaction he had to put up with. If only John could be here. John was a nice buffer. But Microft had strictly forbidden that as well. Apparently John had made himself famous as well (pity). The students did not look as intelligent and as attentive as he would have preferred but at least with his introductory speech they were wary and kept questioning to a minimum -thanks for small mercies. If John could see him now, he would probably have a coronary withholding his laughter.
Gathering his belongings, Sherlock retreated to his office, the place where he could truly be himself. Sherlock prepared to delve deeper into his undercover role. He had successfully integrated himself into the Sheffield staff, but now he needed to explore the hostels and befriend the on-site staff or students to establish his surveillance network. Mentally reviewing the briefing provided by Microft, he reminded himself of the gang's illicit activities involving weed trading and human trafficking within the university hostels.
-General POV-
As the class broke general buzz of excitement filled the air as the students filled out of the classroom. They had heard rumors of a new professor joining their ranks, but nothing could have prepared them for the sight that had greeted them. Standing before them was a young man, only a few years older than themselves, yet exuding an air of confidence and intelligence that was both captivating and surprising.
In another corner of the university, Sherlock's plans were set in motion. He made his way to the staff lounge, where he could review the layout of the hostels and devise a plan to gather information. The need for discreet surveillance was paramount, and Sherlock contemplated the best approach. A combination of befriending on-site staff and blending in with the surroundings. This was going to be both exciting and painstaking.
