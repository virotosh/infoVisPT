Then Moriarty 
.
Danielle could already feel the heat of the bomb on her skin. The boom of it loudly hitting her ears. Already, Danielle could see the building being broken around them. She could see it, feel it, hear it-
Wait no.
She wasn't hearing explosions or screams.
She heard...
Moriarty rolled his eyes. "D'you mind if I get that?"
Danielle gawked.
"No, no, please. You've got the rest of your life." Sherlock replied.
Moriarty pulled his phone out from his jacket pocket. Danielle still watched, confused. "Hello? ...Yes, of course it is. What do you want?" Moriarty leaned away from the phone. 'Sorry!' He mouthed.
 Danielle thought.
Danielle looked back at John. He was just as confused as Danielle felt. Sherlock? Well he kept his eyes focused on Moriarty without ever wavering.
"SAY THAT AGAIN!"
Danielle pressed her back against the wall.
"Say that again, and know that if you're lying to me, I will find you and I will 
." Moriarty warned.
Danielle looked up. Sherlock met her eyes, eyebrow raised in concern.
"Wait." Moriarty stepped forward. He gazed down at the bomb jacket. Danielle's heart raced. "Sorry." He spoke softly, like this actually embarrassed him. "Wrong day to die."
"Oh. Did you get a better offer?" Sherlock asked.
Moriarty glanced at the phone. He started walking back the way he came. "You'll be hearing from me, Sherlock." He raised the phone back up. "So if you have what you say you have, I will make you rich. If you don't, I'll make you into shoes." He clicked his fingers before walking out the door.
Danielle glanced at her chest. The red dots vanished. On all of them.
"...please tell me either of you understood what just happened." Danielle asked.
"Someone changed his mind." Sherlock answered. "The question is: 
?"
==MPH==
Danielle stood in front of the fireplace, Nightwing in her arms and Erika at her feet. Sherlock sat in his chair. John sat in his comfortable arm chair.
Felix and Paul sat on the couch. Felix heard about Danielle being kidnapped, and after already hearing about the shooting last week and then this? Felix freaked. He immediately called Paul and Lilly Kelly. Lilly Kelly was out of town, so she's missing the meeting.
Her mother stood in the middle, ignoring the offered seat. The client seat, as John called it.
But Clarice Nolan was not a client. Nor would she ever be a client, as far as Danielle was concerned. Danielle was too mad to ever believe Clarice Nolan could be a client. She wouldn't ever even want to be, as she was. Clarice wore a white dress with a gold belt, nude sandals, black sunglasses, and golden jewelry. Her yellow gold hair was pulled up into a tight bun. Any graying or brown hairs had been dyed- Danielle knew her mom liked having it that color.
Yeah. Her mum loved to cover things up.
"Sit in the chair." Danielle ordered.
Mrs Nolan took off her sunglasses, revealing blue eyes. The same blue as Danielle's. "Mins your tone. I won't be spoken to like that, Danielle."
"
." Danielle repeated.
"Oi, Danielle, show some respect!" Paul scolded. "It's 
 Not one of those people you chase."
"Exactly. I'm the mother. Why should I?" Mrs. Nolan snapped. "You don't get to order me about!"
"
" Sherlock revealed.
Clarice showed 
"Take a seat." Sherlock instructed. He smiled too thin. "Please."
Clarice lowered herself into the chair. Paul leaned forward.
"Who's that?" Paul asked.
"Is he the bomber?" Felix asked.
"Yes." Danielle answered.
"Bomber? What bomber?" Paul asked. "The one from the paper, the other day?"
"How do you know that name?" Mrs. Nolan snapped.
"He's London's latest in a long line of dangers." Sherlock explained. " a consulting criminal. Organized many cases of crime, from suicides to murders. He spent the past week stringing people up with bombs. Including Danielle."
Mrs. Nolan shook her head.
"We moved away when I was seven." Danielle reminded her family. "I remember you being so 
. Why?"
"I don't have to tell you." Mrs Nolan replied..
"It's fine. I already guessed it's Carl Powers." Danielle explained.
"Who?" Paul asked. "What the hell is going on? What are you doing?"
"Paul, leave it!" Felix said. "We're not here to fight! We're here for Danielle."
Paul scoffed. "You may be here for that. I'm not. You know she's the reason Nathalie broke up with me!"
"
was your own fault!" Danielle snapped. Erika growled at her feet. "If you hadn't cheated on her-"
"Alright! Alright." John sat up. He gave Danielle a look.
Danielle took a breath, brushing on her cat's fur. "Moriarty took me. From my flat." She took another inhale, brushing Nightwing's fur again. Erika stood closer to her legs, curling her tail around them. "And put a bomb on my chest, and guns at my head. And the heads of my friends."
"Oh god." Felix gasped.
Paul gawked. "Seriously?" He asked John. "She's not having a go at us?" Danielle rolled her eyes.
John glanced at Sherlock. The consulting detective didn't look away from Mrs. Nolan. "He did, yeah."
"I was with him for four hours." Danielle swallowed. The action sounded painful. It 
 painful. "He talked for all of it." She glared up at her mother. "Told me all about 
"Who is that?" Felix asked.
"Carl Powers. Died in 1989 of botunlinum poisioning via his shoes." Sherlock explained. He grinned sharply at Mrs. Nolan. "Moriarty did it."
"Said he did it because I asked. His 
." Danielle revealed. "Is it true?" Danielle asked.
Her mother didn't answer.
"Danielle you can't believe him-" Paul asked.
"You 
Felix tried.
"
Danielle shouted over them. "Was David Nolan my father? Tell me!"
"Yes." Mrs. Nolan answered. "Moriarty is your brother."
Silence.
One could hear a pin drop in 221b. Or hear Erika growling. Or Nightwing purring.
Danielle felt tears burning. She refused to let them out.
"An affair, then?" Sherlock asked.
"It wasn't an affair, not really." Mrs. Nolan excused, keeping her nose turned up. Paul and Felix gawked at their mother. "We just enjoyed each other's company."
Sherlock hummed. "An affair. You were more invested than he was."
Mrs. Nolan glared.
"Well it stopped after you were pregnant with his child, and he wanted nothing to do with you." Sherlock explained. "Or the child."
"Ian left for 
"
"When did David find out? Before or after the birth?" Sherlock asked. Mrs. Nolan seethed. "Before."
"Of course he found out! Found the bloody pregnancy test. He got so excited! I couldn't get rid of the damn thing." Mrs. Nolan snapped. "Even after I told him it wasn't his, he still wanted it!"
 Danielle reminded herself, chewing on her cheek.
"That little freak found out." Mrs. Nolan explained. "Somehow. Something wasn't right about him- even then. He had these dead eyes...like he knew every bad thing you'd ever thought." She sneered at her daughter. "He kept trying to get close to you. Teachers did what they could, but then you would play outside with him. I could hear the games you would play- solving murders and re-enacting them. You were 
."
Danielle curled on herself. Sherlock put a hand on her shoulder, squeezing.
"She was a child." John told the woman sitting in the client's seat. "
."
Mrs. Nolan shook her head fiercely. "No, she's not right in her head, Doctor." She glared with Danielle's blue eyes. "You could see it, when she was a kid, that she was 
 like 
."
The words were hurting Danielle. Sherlock could see the way she clenched her fists over the ends of her sleeves.
"She had his dead eyes, they'd just stare at you. Inhuman, that was." Mrs. Nolan went on. "She didn't want friends, or want to do anything but watch that 
 on the telly!" She leaned forward, trying to pull sympathy out from Danielle's closest friends. "My daughter brought up killers and death at the dinner table, the best ways to kill someone without getting caught when she should've been talking about dolls or her friends. What kind of six-year-old is like that?"
'
 was the first person John thought of. He could picture Sherlock and Mycroft debating murder cases over a dinner. "She's not like that." John defended.
Danielle was friendly to everyone she met, especially if they met Sherlock first (and weren't suspects). She doted on her pets. Danielle had even been nice to Sherlock when they met, and John heard Sherlock had insulted her repeatedly.
A horrid thought came into John's head. It wouldn't leave, no matter how sad it was. Danielle hadn't been offended at Sherlock's words because she'd heard something similar (or worse) from her mother.
"Yes, she is. Whatever you've seen, don't buy it. It's all a con. All of it." Her mother argued with an annoyed eye roll. John saw that look so many times when Sherlock had gone on too long a rant. "That girl doesn't care for anybody but herself- that's how Carl died. I knew. Nobody in town could see it but I did. That boy and the little brat murdered a child. I 
to get them away from each other before it got worse."
"
 Felix gasped. He stood up from the couch. Paul rose up with him. "What the hell?"
Danielle held tighter to her cat. Sherlock looked up at her, eyes narrowing. He went back to glaring at Mrs. Nolan.
"Paul! Back me up." Felix prompted.
Danielle snorted. "He won't. He'll take Mum's side like always!"
"Well you 
 a bad kid-" Paul offered.
"But not a 
!" Felix argued.
"No, but she 
." Mrs. Nolan accused.
Danielle flinched. "I was 
."
"And plotting murder!" Mrs. Nolan argued.
"I didn't know he was serious!"
"Oh don't give me 
." Mrs. Nolan dismissed. "You knew. 
you knew! You 
 with him! You and that boy were always off together! Bad seeds, 
 I had to get my family out of there before you started hurting them next!"
Erika barked. Nightwing hissed.
"
 Sherlock snapped.
Erika stopped. She walked over to Sherlock's legs, resting her head on his leg. Nightwing curled again in their mistress' arms. Danielle turned from her mom, facing the mirror instead.
"Thank you, Mrs. Nolan. We have no more need of you." Sherlock stood up from his seat. He buttoned up his jacket. Erika stayed at his feet. "See yourself out."
"See here-"
"Come on, Mum." Paul walked up to his mother's side. Taking her arm, he guided her away. He spared no glances to his siblings.
Felix stayed standing. He glared at his mother and brother's retreating form.
"John. Tea?" Sherlock prompted.
"Got it." John stood up, walking back to towards the kitchen.
"Felix." Sherlock began. "Your sister is crying. Help me guide her to John's chair."
Felix moved fast. Sherlock put his hand on Danielle's arm. She turned, cheeks wet and lip trembling.
"Danielle?" Sherlock asked. He lowered his voice, leaning in closer to her. "Come on."
Danielle shook her head. She sniffled, barely holding back a sob. As Sherlock and Felix gently guided her to the seat, Nightwing jumped from her arms.
"It's alright." Sherlock wrapped his arm around Danielle, sitting on John's armrest. "It's alright."
She pressed her face against his coat. Felix held her hand, squeezing it tight. "I'm- she's-"
"Forget her." Sherlock replied. "She's an idiot."
But Danielle didn't hear it. Instead, she cried.
