Writers and Readers must unite to force this site to change. In the past, a writer received information on how many view/visitors we get to our stories. Over the last two months, we have received nothing. No information as to how many readers are reading our stories. So we write hard pouring our heart into our work and aren't even given information on if anyone is reading our stories. If you're a writer, you know how demoralizing this is. Seeing how many readers helps motivate us and they have taken that away.
We supply the products for free that this site uses to sell ads. The least they can do is provide us with reader information.
Absolutely. This site used to but quit a couple of months ago and after over 50 support requests, we have heard nothing. If there is a problem they should have responded at least via X, but nothing.
It's apparent they don't care about its workers and that would be us writers whose work pays their salaries or they would fix the traffic stat problem. Why else would they not fix it? If there's a hardware or some other kind of issue, they could let people know via X, but still nothing.
To the readers who don't like this approach we're using to try to force this site to change, what should we do? We've tried support requests. Can you put yourself into the shoes of the writer who writes for free and is entitled to basic reader information but due to the callous treatment by this site is deprived of this information? How would you feel?
