John leant up against the reception desk. He sighed. "I'm here for Sherlock".
"Sorry?", the man on the other side replied.
"Sherlock. How much is it this time?".
"I'm going to need a surname", the man said bluntly.
"Oh, you must be new here".
"Sorry?", the man furrowed his eyebrows.
"You're new, aren't you?".
"Yes I- how did you-"
"Never mind". John took out his wallet. "Holmes. Sherlock Holmes, how much is the bail?".
The man clicked some keys. "Uh. 250 pounds or three nights in a cell".
"Obviously I'm going to pay". John sighed and took the money out of his wallet. "God he better pay me back". He gave the money to the man. "What'd he do this time?".
"This time..?". The man trailed, he cleared his throat when he realised John wasn't going elaborate. "Says here that he punched a police officer".
"That idiot. Does it say which officer?".
"Don't worry, sir. It says that the officer in question is not going to press charges".
"Who is it, anyways?".
"Sir I don't think the name will mean-"
"Just tell me the name", John pressured.
"Right". He cleared his throat. "A man on the forensics team called Phillip Anderson".
John laughed. "Ah he probably had it coming". He tapped the desk. "So which cell is he in?".
"Um. Cell four, just take a-"
"I know where it is", John smiled. He left the puzzled man and made his way to Sherlock. When he got there Sherlock shot up instantly. "What took you so long!?".
John shrugged. "Was talking to the newbie". He put his hands on the cell bars. "So tell me why you punched Anderson".
"How'd you find out so quickly?".
"Asked the newbie. So what happened?".
"I'll tell you when you let me out. You came here without an officer?".
John put his hand in his pocket and whipped out a key.
"How did you get that?", Sherlock's eyebrows shot up.
John grinned. "Pit pocketed a guard the last time we were here. Thought it'd speed things up next time around and look at that", he unlocked the door. "It did. Now come on, tell me what happened".
Puzzled but elated Sherlock left the cell. "You are a marvel, John Watson".
"I know", he smiled up at him. "So tell me what Anderson did to deserve you decking him".
"Who are they?", the newbie asked as he watched the two men leave.
"Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson".
