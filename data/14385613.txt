With both an ecstatic and sultry grin, he walked closer to Sherlock, placed both hands on his face, and kissed him.
A tremendous feeling of 'what was to come' overcame Sherlock.
During dinner, they exchanged intense stares, subtle signals, and gentle touches, all intended to ignite something more serious later.
They were seated with glasses of champagne, and their spoken words failed to hint at the unspoken.
Their eyes instead held an intensity that relayed the exact message their words did not.
Their leisurely rhythm was even more seductive, allowing them to develop into ever-deepening subtleties only they could a result of fate, this would be their last encounter.
They embraced, and their bodies swayed — they wove back and forth as if in a dance —at first loosely linked until they merged into a single entity.
They drowned in each other's arms.
Their limbs coiled around their torsos in a serpentine manner.
They probed with tongues, they consumed, they nibbled, they was the dim light of the early dawn that awakened Sherlock.
His face rested on the chest of the one who had previously claimed his body.
He ached from both bodily and emotional pain and felt the visible and hidden evidence of their intense involvement.
He longed for this to continue, to endure both the mental and physical suffering willingly.
Acceptable as long as he was allowed to remain in this this brief rendezvous had to come to an end.
Without wanting to wake his lover, Sherlock cautiously got out of bed, and since he feared the unpleasantness of saying goodbye, he promptly dressed without left the hotel and entered the scheduled car that waited at the curb.
He boarded the private jet, and after it ascended into the sky, his chin dropped to his chest.
He focused his gaze on the window to conceal the tears that streamed down his face.A sleek black limousine awaited him and brought him to the heart of London—the city where he had previously lived and still cherished.
He arrived at his destination — 221B Baker Street.
The key to his flat had accompanied him during his time away —never out of one pocket or another.
He positioned himself in the hallway and, after a brief moment of uncertainty, began up the seventeen steps that led to his flat.
Upon opening the door, he inhaled and saw that his books, paperwork, and folders were precisely in the same condition as he had left them.
The sour aroma of his most recent study on the physiological impacts of oranges still lingered in the air.
He threw himself on the sofa, his face buried in its cushioned back.
Overwhelmed by a sense of isolation and disorientation, his tears flowed from his eyes.
Life was over for him.
The concept that he would never be able to reunite with the only love he had ever had in his whole life was incomprehensible to hunger ultimately roused him from his stupor and brought him back to reality.
Before he did anything more, he took a shower to remove the last of the lingering scent of his beloved, as well as his sex and his , Sherlock walked casually to the kitchen while towel-drying his hair.
Tea with a slice of toast covered in sweet jelly was all he could manage.
His desire to meet his City — London — grew so intense he gulped the last of the still-hot brew and dressed quickly.
He put on an ivory-colored shirt, a custom-made steel blue three-piece suit, and black shoes before he descended the staircase.
About midway down, he abruptly became aware that he had overlooked something.
A crucial component of his attire.
He returned to his flat and bedroom, opened the wardrobe, and retrieved his double-breasted Belstaff Coat.
He donned the familiar coat and lifted the collar to cover his neck.
He removed the blue wool scarf from its hook and knotted it around his neck before he stepped out the door.
He couldn't help the slight grin on his face as the memory of it pulled at him.
His footsteps were light as he trod down the stairway toward the door and the outside became a habit to rise early each day and diligently tour different city regions until well into the wee hours of the morning.
It was his city — his London.
He had to familiarize himself with it again like one would while visiting their childhood home.
At night, he visited the tawdry sex houses but never partook.
Heaven knew he wanted to, but the notion of now touching a stranger's body repelled him.
He also refrained from the deep desire to hide his sorrow behind doses of drugs.
And so he continued his journey on foot — and all the while, he stored all the unfamiliar locations in his mind with no other thought than his usual determination to know all of London, including its a lengthy morning exploration of the Imperial War Museum, he walked outside as the clouds gathered.
At first, it was a slow, lazy drizzle, but then it intensified, and he sought shelter in the first doorway he found, the entrance to Bart's Hospital.A little sigh came out of his mouth.
Bart's was a flashback to his past as he once had taken charge of a little laboratory located at the far end of a corridor on the higher level of the hospital.
With only a nod to the receptionist, he ascended the steps instead of using the elevator.
He opened the double swinging doors with a heavy heart, unsure what to expect. His eyes scanned his environment, ready to analyze.
The area had just undergone cleaning, as evident by the discernible aroma of lemon-scented detergent.
The two large white porcelain sinks were dry, and the tables lacked lab glass or microscopes.
He unfolded one of the two metal chairs, which clanged noisily against the table.
For the years he had utilized this workstation, he had used one of the several closets that lined the wall.
He was surprised to find his microscope, flasks, and assorted science equipment on the shelves still in the order he had laid them out.
He had surmised that after all this time, someone would have usurped the space for their usage.
He rubbed his hands together in anticipation as he arranged a selection of the flasks and beakers on the table with unexpected excitement.
He set up his microscope and found a jar that held a man's finger preserved and ready for experimentation.
Unexpectedly, the experience of returning to one of his previous favorite places was turning out to be extremely gratifying.
He opened two drawers of an old apothecary cabinet, and his old slides were still in there — untouched.
He perceived that nobody had approached this room except for cleaning purposes. With an unforeseen delight, he grasped a pipette and became engrossed in his experiment.
The doors swung open, and he perceived the sound more than he saw observed it.
Two individuals entered the room, prompting him to raise his eyes out of interest.
One was Mike, a person he had known for a considerable amount of time and with whom he had recently reestablished contact.
The other —.
A man with sandy hair and blue eyes.
He entered with a limp and a cane in hand.
Sherlock immediately noted that he did not need the cane he was holding.
Also, he was recently a soldier.
So he observed, amongst other quick deductions.
Something about the man fascinated him, and so Sherlock allowed him entrance into his world.
The man was — John Watson.
