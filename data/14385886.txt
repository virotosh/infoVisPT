Bet on the Wrong Hearse
Just a little ficlet I did one day, hope you like it! Post Reichenbach Fall, but before the end of 3X01.
When Sherlock received the cryptic text from Lestrade, he was intrigued and wary in equal measure. The message had been brief and enigmatic, hinting at something significant but offering no details. Sherlock met Lestrade on the corner near the bank, his curiosity piqued.
Lestrade wasted no time diving into his explanation. "Now that that mess with the train is all cleaned up," he began, "I need you to come with me to settle something before the press release."
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "Settle what?"
Lestrade led him to an ATM, where he withdrew a substantial sum—twenty notes totaling no less than £1000. As he counted out the notes with methodical precision, he added, "A bet."
Sherlock followed Lestrade as he hailed a cab, and they set off toward another part of the city. As the familiar streets of London passed by, Sherlock felt a mixture of curiosity and amusement, along with the welcome relief of being home.
Lestrade looked out the window, his expression thoughtful. "I don't think you appreciate how hard your death hit everyone," he said. "But one of the people it hit the hardest was Anderson."
Sherlock's expression turned incredulous. " 
? Why?"
Lestrade chuckled softly, a hint of weariness in his voice. "He and Donovan were the ones who pushed me to go to the super about you, pushed for the investigation into whether you were a fraud. Then, when word came that you'd jumped off St. Bart's and died, and it turned out you were innocent… Sherlock, I've never seen a live man look so pale. He was wracked with guilt, convinced he'd driven you to it. It really tore him up."
"Anderson hated me." Sherlock said in a measured tone. "Why would he react so badly?"
Lestrade shook his head. "I don't think he hated you as much as he let on. Deep down, he admired you—what you did, how you did it. But about a year ago, right after you were proven innocent, he left the Yard and started this little club of his. He called it 'The Empty Hearse.'"
"The Empty Hearse?"
"Yeah. He began spinning these elaborate theories about how you weren't really dead, and that you had somehow faked your own death. He based it on stories surfacing about cases around the world being solved in ways that had your fingerprints all over them."
Sherlock gave him a sidelong glance but chose not to comment further.
Lestrade continued, "So, in this club, people would come up with wild theories about how you faked your death. It became a bit of an obsession for him, and had a pretty wide following. He got so insistent that I finally told him, 'Anderson, if Sherlock ever comes back, I'll give you a thousand pounds!' And well, now…"
He slapped the money against his leg a couple of times. "Bollocks."
As they approached Anderson's house, Lestrade signaled Sherlock to wait to the side, out of sight. He then walked up to the door and knocked with a firm but measured rap.
Anderson answered swiftly, his face lighting up when he saw Lestrade. "Morning, Lestrade! Good to see you as always, but I'm afraid I'm still not coming back to the Yard. Unless you have a theory you'd like to run by me?"
Lestrade let out a weary sigh and reached into his pocket. He pulled out the stack of notes, his expression a mix of resigned humor and mild exasperation. He counted out the money with deliberate care, then held it up to Anderson with a theatrical flourish. "£1000, as promised, you smug bastard."
Anderson looked at the money, his expression shifting from confusion to realization. His gaze traveled to Sherlock, who had stepped into view behind Lestrade. Anderson's confusion quickly transformed into astonishment, then pure, unrestrained joy.
" 
!" Anderson exclaimed, his voice bursting with excitement. He surged forward and, without hesitation, wrapped Sherlock in a tight, exuberant hug. "I knew it, I 
 knew it! You beautiful, clever bastard!" He laughed heartily, his enthusiasm palpable.
Sherlock, initially taken aback by the embrace, managed to return it with a bemused smile. "Hello, Anderson."
Anderson pulled back, still grinning widely. "Holy shit! This is incredible! You're really here!" he said as he ran his hands through his hair in disbelief.
"I'm here, and here to stay, hopefully." Sherlock said with some awkwardness.
Anderson's expression turned serious, and he took a deep breath. "Sherlock, I'm…I'm sorry. I am sorry for every mean thing I ever said, for calling you a freak, calling you a psychopath, blaming you for—"
Sherlock raised his hand, his face a mixture of patience and mild amusement. "Water under the bridge, Anderson. But just so we're clear, you're still not allowed into my flat."
Anderson's laughter returned, though it was tinged with a touch of sheepishness. "Well, I'm not with the Yard anymore, so there's no chance of that happening anyway. So, when did you get back?"
"A few days ago," Sherlock said smugly. "But there was a matter that I needed to see to before announcing my return to the world at large."
Anderson's brow quirked downward in question, before his eyes grew large. "It was that business with the bomb under parliament, wasn't it? You figured that out!"
"I did, and along the way, uncovered a much larger plot that needs looking into."
"Well, of course you did." Anderson said with a huff. "I'd offer my help, but I know you don't think very highly of my skills, or lack thereof."
Sherlock looked thoughtful. "Oh I don't know, I think you made a fairly good deduction when you asserted that I had faked my own death, and you even had the right evidence in the form of tracking those cases. There may be hope for you yet!"
Anderson blinked in disbelief, and pointed at Sherlock while giving Lestrade an incredulous look. "You sure this is Sherlock?"
"Funny," Sherlock deadpanned. He turned and began walking away. "Good afternoon, Anderson!"
As Lestrade turned to follow him, Anderson called out, his voice tinged with hopeful curiosity. "Oi, Sherlock! Any chance you'd be willing to tell me how you did it? You know, closure for the club?"
Sherlock smirked, his eyes twinkling with mischief. "I'll drop by tomorrow and give you the full story."
Anderson's face lit up with enthusiasm. "Great! I'll be looking forward to it."
As the two men strode away, Lestrade nudged Sherlock. "See, he doesn't hate you. In fact, I'm pretty sure he's in love!"
"How do you think Donovan will react?" Sherlock asked.
"That's a good question…" Lestrade said thoughtfully. "Wanna go find out?"
"I do, yes." Sherlock answered. "I'm finding that the reactions to my return are both mixed, and unexpected. It's been quite an entertaining week!"
Hope you enjoyed reading my little contribution to the Sherlock fandom! I'd love to see a review, even just a few words; It boosts my ego and keeps me writing!
