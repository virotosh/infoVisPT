"I that a am lost; oh, who will find me? Deep down below; the old beech treeâ€¦
You trapped me in hell, brother. But I'll get my revenge. However hard you try, I will. I will rise
When the demons walk.
I will get my peace
When the demons walk.
I will not warn you - you'll never know what I want. I will straight away wrap my victim is silk; my web is made to sticky thread.
I have come to get what I want. Won't die until it's complete. I'll come, brother,
When the demons walk.
oOo They weep beside a grave, a grave of a person.
Who didn't saw the sun for decades.
Who didn't know why she was kept like this.
Who wanted revenge, never got one.
Who was lost, is lost and will be lost forever.
"I'm so sorry, Eurus."
The demons never walked; the light never came; she remained lost.
For far too late.
