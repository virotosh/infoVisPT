"Hello, Gregory. What's the case?" Sherlock asked when he and Jhon arrived at the crime scene.
"Murder. 2 different parts of London, 1 at the bridge. Sh-" He stopped himself when he saw Sherlock cover his ears.
"You alright?" John asked.
"Y-yeah, just the voice was too loud." Sherlock replied.
John didn't mind it at all. As long as he was not calling Lestrade 'Greg'. The crime scene went as usual, Sherlock telling his deductions and throwing insults at Donovan and Anderson.
oOoOoOo
When they returned home, Sherlock locked himself up in his room and didn't come out for like an hour John got worried and tried to face it. He knocked at the door. No reply.
He waited.
No reply.
After a few minutes he went without knocking. Surprised to see the consulting detective curled up on his bed.
The medical man switched from 'flatmate' to doctor mode.
"Sherlock?" he asked. The answer was a groan.
He checked his pulse. It was very fast. "Christ." he murmured.
He looked at the detective. He was crying.
Sherlock Holmes does not cry.
"Too loud. Too much." he heard him whisper.
"Hush. It's all right." It was only then when a child started crying and he fainted. John took him to .
On the way, he was not an easy person to be held up. The doctors mentioned that he fainted because of Sensory overload.
From that day on, he kept an eye on him to prevent others. Who can guess that the world's only consulting detective has SPD?
