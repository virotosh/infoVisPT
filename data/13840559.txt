"Oi there's a visitor", Sally called from the hallway of the crime scene.
"Tell them to fuck off", Sherlock replied over the dead body.
"They're not here for you, Holmes". At that Sherlock picked up his head. "They're here for Watson".
"For me?", John raised his eyebrows. "Who is it?".
Sally shrugged. "Dunno, he said it was important. Hasn't seen you in while". Sally's eyes widened. "Oh should mention he's in a military uniform".
"John what the hell have you done?", Greg asked from the wall.
"He hasn't done anything, detective inspector. It's most likely an army mate", Sherlock said.
John nodded. "Most likely. I haven't seen most of my mates in a while, majority are still out there. I don't know how they'd find me though at the crime scene..it doesn't make sense...unless oh-". John paused mid-thought and looked frantically at the people in the room.
"John what's wrong?". Greg stepped closer to him. John turned to Sally instead. "The bloke got blonde hair, blue eyes and a scar on his left cheek?".
"Uhh yeah. Yeah he does. Nasty scar, couldn't keep my eyes off it. Who know him then?".
"Yes", he grumbled. "Where is he?".
"Just outside".
"Who is he?", Sherlock asked. John didn't dignify that with a response. Everyone followed John outside of the house, forgetting about the dead woman inside. Once outside they were met with a man of short stature in military fatigues. John visibly straightened up and marched over to him, he saluted then stood at ease. The man saluted back then grinned wickedly. "Johnny boy!", he exclaimed and brought him into a manly hug.
The other three people stood back and watched the scene with curious eyes.
John patted the man on the back. "Hello", he muttered. The man pulled back and smiled at him. "Look at you! Haven't grown an inch have ya?".
John shrugged. "Neither have you".
"Oh don't be like that, Johnny. Haven't seen you in ages. Speaking of, what the bloody hell are you doing on a crime scene?".
"I work here", John replied bluntly.
"Work here? So you're a copper now?".
John shook his head. "No. I don't work for them, I just help out sometimes".
The man furrowed his eyebrows. "How'd you get into that, Johnny? This what you've been doing since you came home?".
John sighed and rubbed his face. "Can we talk somewhere else?".
The man grinned. "Don't want your old man embarrassing you in front of your friends".
"Let's just go". He turned back to the three questioning faces. "Guys I've got to go. Sherlock I'll see you at home". Before he could reply the man grabbed John's arm. "What do you mean home? You live with him?".
John yanked his arm away. "Yes. I do".
"So what you're gay then?".
Sally gasped, John grew red. "Dad", he protested.
"Don't you dad me", he gritted. "Answer the question now".
"No". John cleared his throat. "I am not gay".
His dad looked sceptical and glanced between John and Sherlock. "So you're not shagging the fag?".
John clenched his fists in fury and stepped between Sherlock and his dad. "Leave now".
"Oh come on, Johnny. I'm just playing with you", he grinned. "So you're not shagging, mind if I touch?".
"What?".
His dads eyes blazed with something within. "He's pretty".
John swallowed the bile down his throat. "Yes he is. I would now kindly ask you to leave. There are two officers of law here by the way".
His dad laughed. "Oh hello. Let me introduce myself. General Watson". He held out his hand to Greg who reluctantly took it. "Detective Inspector Lestrade".
"Just go, Dad. We have to work to do".
"Oh but I didn't even get to introduce myself to the pretty lady", he pouted. John moved forward to create space between his father and friends. "I don't know what you're playing at. I haven't seen you since I left for the army and you turn up on the crime scene disrespecting my friends".
The general was taken aback. "You've changed, Johnny".
"I'm not scared of you, anymore".
The man smiled sadly. "No, I suppose you're not. I'm just pulling your leg, Johnny. Just wanted to see how you're doing".
"Well I'm doing fine". John spat. "Now leave".
His dad put his hands up in mock surrender. "I know when I'm not wanted". He saluted John and his son automatically saluted back. "Captain Watson".
John nodded. "General Watson".
John's dad ducked under the tape and got into his government issued car and drove away. John turned back to meet his friends. "I'm so sorry guys. If he made you uncomfortable, do file a bloody complaint. I'll have your backs".
"So that was your dad?", Sally asked slowly. John nodded. "I won't file a complaint".
"I don't care if you did it. Wouldn't blame you. He's a right dick".
"Didn't know your old man was a general", Greg said.
"Yeah. He's the reason I got into the army, you know?". John rubbed his face. "Look, I'm sorry about what happened. He's just a prick, doesn't know boundaries".
"He's homophobic?", Sherlock asked.
"Christ knows", John shrugged. "He got pissed when Harry came out but then he was fine with it. I dunno man".
"It's alright, mate". Greg patted him in the shoulder. "Let's go back".
"Anderson has probably botched the whole scene", Sherlock grumbled.
"Sorry about that. Didn't expect my dad to just show up. Haven't seen him since I got deployed". They walked back towards the entrance of the house. "So that's been what like ten years?", Sally asked.
"Something like that, yeah".
"John?", Sherlock asked.
"Mhm?".
"You said I was pretty".
John paused in the hallway. "What?".
"Your dad said I was pretty and you agreed".
John's cheeks turned pink. "Oh. Well I didn't realise I said that".
Sherlock looked down at his feet, Greg and Sally had moved on. "Did you mean it?".
"Hm?".
"Did you mean it? The thing you said".
"Oh". John fiddled with the hem of his jumper. "Yeah er. Obviously. Yeah".
Sherlock flushed pink. "Um. Okay".
John took a hesitant step forward. "Sherlock, you do know you're attractive right?".
"I mean I've always known I'm conventionally attractive but um no ones ever said it out loud".
"Oh". John furrowed his eyebrows then he looked up at him and his eyes softened. "Well you are, pretty that is. You're very pretty".
"Thank you, John".
"Oi, you two what're you doing? Anderson needs to take the body to Molly", Greg yelled. John sighed and squeezed Sherlock's forearm. "Come on, genius".
