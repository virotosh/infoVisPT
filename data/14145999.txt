Watson broke his left shoulder, during a case where a spice storage was set on fire, which caused an explosion that threw Holmes and Watson against a wall, John sadly taking the worse hit. Being left handed, this cut deep into Dr. Watson's routine, leaving him with such a sore right arm, that he could hardly move that one either. He was detained from work and issued a nurse, but Sherlock and her met heads on at the first occasion, not letting it end well. The result being, that now Sherlock would have to chip in for the missing nurse, until they could get a substitute. John went to bed angry that night, mustering the strength he could gather and getting undressed and to bed alone.
