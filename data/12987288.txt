"
Words which echoed in her mind as she paced in the living room of his flat. How dare he say such words?
True, she should not have been listening to his conversation with Watson, but it was hard to ignore when she was in the closet of the lab, retrieving supplies.
Obviously, he did not realize she had stepped in the closet or he wouldn't have said such words.
After he and Watson had left, when she refused to make her presence known, she debated and debated what to do next.
Now, here she was, in his flat, needing to speak to him.
Crazy at it may seem, she needed to set the records straight.
"Molly?"
She stopped mid-pace and slowly turned to face him. "He's not my fiancé." She responded, dropping her arms to her side.
Sherlock studied her, his eyes focusing on her finger which at the moment was ringless. "Molly…"
"It was fake. All of it, he agreed to help because of what was going on with Moriarty. He did it as a favor. You see he's my cousin's beau and well, she let him help because she's like a sister. It was never intended to carry on as far as it did." She explained, hurriedly. "I…just wanted you to know." She added, bowing her head.
Time froze between them, her eyes downcast on the floor. His focused on her.
With quick strides, he approached her and in a scene from a romantic film, he cupped her face and lifted it to place his lips on hers.
After a moment of heated, passionate snogging, he lifted his head. "Good, one pompous twit in your life is enough."
She laughed and brought his head down again in a gentle kiss, letting him know that he was the only twit for her.
