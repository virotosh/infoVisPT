Once we were innocent,
Only children,
Through even then we were to smart to fear the dark,
We were different,
Each other was all we had,
Nobody else understood; pure intellect,
But things change,
One got lost in jealousy,
Three become two; who became one in the end,
Split we became,
One forgotten,
The second hated,
The third lost on a hunt for something he will never know.
