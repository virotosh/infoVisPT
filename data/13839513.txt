"What?" he said, stopping short as she stood in front of him, hands on her hips. "I told you I'd see you before I left-"
"At my flat!" she hissed, staring wildly around the room, half-expecting police and doctors and John bloody Watson to come storming in after him. "Not here, where anyone can see you!
