(Sherlocks Pov)
"You're dead!", John yelled but it couldn't stop me from laughing.
He stepped forward.
"You're 
"
Now he stood right in front of me.
"I hate you!", he said while laughed.
"I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!" his voice got louder.
"No, you don't." I said, still giggling a bit.
"No I don't" he said, and I smiled.
"I love you." 
"I love you.", he said again, and he said it as a fact. Like it was normal to say this to me.
"And now I'm leaving because it was an embarrassing moment."
He turned away and at this moment I grabbed him and pulled him back to me.
I grinned.
And then, I kissed him.
It was a short kiss. More a pressing-lips-against-lips. Not more.
But I loved it.
Well, John didn't.
"What was that?"
"A kiss."
"Yeah, of course it was a kiss. But why?"
"Because you love me."
He sighed.
"But that doesn't mean… I mean, Molly likes you too and you didn't kiss her!" He frowned.
"Or did you?"
"Well, actually yes, but it was more a thank-you. It wasn't something serious."
He gasped. "Well, and this? What was this?"
I grinned. "A kiss, obviously."
He closed his eyes, then he said slow and angry: "Sherlock, why did you kiss me?"
"Because", I said, pulling him closer, "I wanted to."
You're an idiot! You're such an idiot!"
I kissed him again.
"Well, I could get used to this."
"Yeah?" He nodded.
"Uhm, can you do it again?"
"I don't know…" I grinned.
"Just kiss me again!"
I kissed him again.
"I really could get used to this."
