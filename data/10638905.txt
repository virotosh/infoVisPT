Everything was going well, until about four minutes after the Detective and the Doctor had walked onto the crime scene to consult with Lestrade and, as Sherlock had put it, "solve the case before the idiots took over".
Greg had called with what sounded like a solid "8" on Sherlock's Scale of Crimes: a windowless room locked from the inside, a missing early Picasso and, best of all, a body!
The Detective curtly gestured for the D.I. and the Doctor to wait in the doorway while he carefully examined both the body and the room. The body, the ex-Mrs. Griggs-Barton, showed no signs of violence and the room was pristine, except for the open door of a now-empty wall safe.
Suddenly Sherlock threw his hands the air and a string of invective issued from his mouth, shocking both John and Greg into silence. The language Sherlock was using was enough to make the proverbial stevedore blush!
"Sherlock! What's wrong?" asked John as he entered the room and slowly approached the agitated Detective who was now shaking his head and muttering, "No, no, no, no!"
At John's hand on his arm, Sherlock quieted, looked up at the ceiling and took a deep breath.
"I'm can't believe I'm going to say this," he said in an aggrieved tone, "but it was the butler!"
