It wasn't surprising to John that he'd got drunk; after all, he had spent the evening at a pub watching a rugby match and had kept on drinking beyond his usual limit without realizing it.
It wasn't startling that he'd had drunken sex, as it had happened to him several times prior to that evening, especially during his years in college.
It wasn't astonishing that he'd just had sex with another man – he had had his share of experience in that field during his time in the military.
Nor was it shocking that said man was none other than Sherlock Holmes; with the sexual tension building up between the two men during the course of their relationship, John had come to accept that it was bound to happen sooner or later.
What was indeed unexpected to him was just how much he had enjoyed it. From start to finish it all had felt so 
; if anything, the only negative feeling he was left with was the regret of not having done it sooner. Such feeling, however, wouldn't last long, as John was sure they would be compensating for the lost time soon enough. So he rolled over, placed an arm around Sherlock and, hugging him tightly, let out a contented sigh before going back to sleep, filled with utter bliss.
So… yesterday I learnt about this thing called a "221B ficlet" (a fic containing 221 words total, last word starts with "b") and I wanted to give it a try. This one also happens to be my first ever Sherlock fic, so I hope, for both my sake and yours, that I managed to do a not-so-lousy job.
Kudos and comments are very welcome!
