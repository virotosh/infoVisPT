THIS HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED AND REMAINS UNFINISHED!
John POV:
It had been a really long day for John Watson. It started with him being startled awake by a nightmare, which was odd since he hadn't had one since he moved into 221B Baker Street. Then just as he was drifting of to sleep again, Sherlock decided that it was a good time to start playing his violin. John wouldn't have minded, but it Sherlock played loudly until about 7:00 a.m. in the morning. Sherlock had been playing for 7 hours straight. After Sherlock finally stopped playing, John managed to dose off. When he woke up, he realized that he had slept through the alarm and was now late for his job interview. John rushed to get ready and get out the door. He skipped breakfast and only paused to glare in Sherlock's direction. John couldn't get a taxi, so he had to walk. On to of that, his leg was acting up. When John got there, he walked in to the office the interview was taking place in. He was about to apologize, but then realized that no one was in the room. He sighed and sat down to wait. Three hours later, the interviewer showed up. The interviewer barely spared him a glance before starting the interview. The interview ended an hour later and John spent the next half-hour doing things for Sherlock. During this, Mycroft kept pestering him with messages asking about Sherlock. John spent another half-hour job searching. He headed back to Baker Street to get lunch, but Sherlock walked out talking on the phone with Lestrade before he could get to the door. John sighed as Sherlock started to drag him into the taxi he managed to hail. Yes, it had been a very long day for John Watson and he had a feeling that it was going to get longer.
