"I love you."

How can three simple words be so much? The elixir of life, the fountain of youth, the fall of an empire and the inevitable feeling of despair. This only scratched the surface. These were words that took courage, took strength yet also the words that took these things away. Nothing should have the power over life and death, yet here he was.

"But why not? Why not!? I've done everything, absolutely everything and what do I have to show for it? Once again, I'm alone, everyone around me is leaving and I can't- I can't stop them, John. Please, I just, I can't take it anymore, just go. Please."

Tears were a natural reaction to an emotional response, be it happy or sad. Apparently death didn't stir up many emotions in him.

"I didn't know, I couldn't. Why? Sherlock, please WHY? Talk to me, for the love of god, talk to me!"

Screaming is quite an unusual thing. It always depends on context. Doesn't everything? Is it an excited child who just met their favourite superhero? Is it a middle aged woman on a roller-coaster, adrenaline coursing through her veins? Or is it a broken man who made the wrong choices at the wrong time?

"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I keep doing this, I keep doing it, don't do this to me, I know it's my fault, it always is, but just, please, I'm begging you, Sherlock. Don't. Don't push me away again."

Oh, blame, that's another one of those things. Everyone thinks it falls on their shoulders, but do they really know? The short answer is no, no they don't. You see, an event isn't a solitary thing. No, an event is the convergence of many different moments in time. There is however a breaking point, the one drop that is just too much. But if everything is a cause, where does the blame fall? Maybe it's just easier to see the fault as our own. Maybe searching for the answer is too taxing, or an impossible task.
When in need of a scapegoat why not use the nearest one?

Dying is very much like a first cigarette. At first you're nervous, fingers shaking slightly, knowing it's wrong but not really caring about the consequences. When you light up and bring it to your lips, you know there is no turning back. You know just how disappointed people will be, but when you feel the warmth going to your lungs all these worries fade away, to leave a pleasant buzzing sensation in their wake. The difference is that with death, you don't come down from the high.
Everything will cease to exist. And thank god for that.

"Sherlock, are you home?"
"Sherl-"
"Oh my god, no, no, no no no no no, this can't be happening."
"Sherlock, please, just don't. Don't do this to me. Please."
"Why? Sherlock, please WHY? Talk to me, for the love of god, talk to me!"
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I keep doing this, I keep doing it, don't do this to me, I know it's my fault, it always is, but just, I'm begging you, Sherlock."

Love is similar to death. It shouldn't be bargained with, lest it takes you with it.
