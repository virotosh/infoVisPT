you didn't kill Mary. John said. Sherlock was looking down. hey. John said walking closer. Sherlock still didn't look up. John crouched Infront of him. you didn't. John put his hands over Sherlock to stop him from fiddling with the tea cup. can you look at me? he asked ducking his head to look at sherlock. Sherlock avoided eye contract keeping his head down.
John sighed. hey, I know you still blame yourself. but you can't. you didn't kill Mary. it was her choice. Sherlock shifted in his seat. do you understand me Sherlock? Sherlock shrugged slightly. that's not an answer. John said frowning. Sherlock's grip tightened on the cup. John gently pried his fingers off of the cup and took it from him putting it on the ground. Sherlock clasped his hands together. you are a good man. John said putting one hand over Sherlock's. and you did not kill Mary.
Sherlock still hadn't made eye contact with John. look at me Sherlock. Sherlock slowly did. their eyes locked. you, John said putting a hand on Sherlock cheek the other running up and down his hand. did not kill her.
but. Sherlock started to speak.
hush. John said. let me finish. you couldn't have done anything to stop it. Sherlock tried to look down again but John didn't let him. hey, I'm not finished yet. Sherlock looked back up tears in his eyes. did you shoot her? John asked keeping eye contact. Sherlock looked confused.
no. he replied.
did you force Mary Infront of you. John asked.
no. Sherlock replied quietly.
what did Mary do? Sherlock didn't answer. Sherlock. answer me. what did Mary do.
I. Sherlock took in a sharp breath. I can't.
yes you can. tell me what did Mary do.
she jumped Infront of me.
and did you force her to do that? John asked his voice rough
no. Sherlock replied
did she do that out of her own free will.
yes. Sherlock whispered a tear spilling over.
John nodded. yes Sherlock. he said tears flowing down his cheeks. she did it because she loved you, and she loved me. Sherlock nodded tears falling freely. John sat back emotions over riding him. he put a hand over his eyes a sob breaking out. Mary. he whispered. he felt arms embrace him.
it's okay. he heard Sherlock whispered.
it's not okay! he sobbed.
no, no it's not. Sherlock replied. but it is what it is.
