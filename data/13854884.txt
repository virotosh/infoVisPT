God Damn you! Come back!
Look, I've shopped for all your favorite foodstuffs. Your ginger snaps, the special English tea you love to have in the evenings.
Tomato sauce for the pasta I purchased.
A new colander.
Remember?
I threw it at you while I was angry, and it missed.
Good thing, too!
But it hit the wall and bounced.
Stopped at the morgue and swiped a jar of human fingers.
And yes, the container is sitting in the fridge on the second shelf, next to the milk.
And that scratch on the desk?
Did you even realize how upset I was when I asked you how it happened, and you ignored me?
I rented a small van, drove it to a refurnishing shop and they did a wonderful job of restoring it to its original state.
You'd never notice the difference between the before and now.
Although, maybe, with your sharp eyes, with your skill at noticing even the minutest change, you might.
I found a book about the solar system which you and I could peruse together.
Your laptop needed an update, and I took care of that.
Even though I disapprove, I stored a pack of cigs in your slipper and more nicotine patches in your room.
So damn it, come back!
Please!
