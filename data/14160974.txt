A/n: I think my a/n is gonna be longer than the story, lol. But this story is basically if Sherlock from Enola Holmes had someone like Mrs. Hudson from Sherlock (bbc). Thus the aftermath of Enola Holmes 2 from his housekeeper/maid's pov. For the sake of the story, just imagine that the movie happened in one week or less. Hope you like it!
"One week, Sherlock. I was gone for 
and you manage to make this place look like a tornado came and get shot in the shoulder... Yes, I know about that. 
 that you haven't gone to get it checked yet!â€¦ I don't care about the case! Health first!"
A/n: If you want more content with the housekeeper/maid then let me know in the comments. However, in my mind she's young so, sorry not sorry if you literally imagined Mrs. Hudson because of my comment lol. Also, really mad that Sherlock getting shot was not a big deal, but otherwise a good movie ;D
Stay safe and see ya soon!
