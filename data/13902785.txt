Mary flew into the elevator, grinning at the third ultrasound photo of her little girl. John would have been at the appointment but he had an emergency client at the clinic. As the door closed, she heard a familiar voice behind her.
"Mary? Oh wow it is you. Wow you look stunning, you're absolutely glowing."
Mary looks back and smiles politely. "David, fancy seeing you here. Thank you. I'm very happy."
David nods and smiles, his eyes looking over her in a way that had always made her uncomfortable, even the brief time they were together. He was also a bit possessive and handsy. Obsessed with her since they had broken up. Mary begins to wonder if it's even a coincidence he was here at this point. Without another word, she turns back around, willing the elevator number to reach her parking garage floor.
Once it finally does, she lets out a sigh as the doors open to the lot. She scuttles a bit, out of the confines of the elevator box. Wondering if he would follow her, she glances behind her shoulder.
Gasping, her eyes land on his body on the elevator floor in a heap, foam trickling out of his mouth, and his eyes rolled back. He was clearly already dead; poisoned by the looks of it. She supposes a man like him had a few enemies, and she wasn't about to let her own past come back to haunt her quite yet. Not to mention being roped into an investigation.
Without hesitation, Mary runs to her car, and leaves Bart's without another word of her dead ex in the elevator.
