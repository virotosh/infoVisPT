"Right!" lestrade said in a loud voice to his whole department, as he walked through the double doors dramatically "you lot" he gestured to about half of his team who where all now looking at him expectantly "are all buying us drinks" he was grinning like a maniac now.
His team looked blankly at him for a few moments before,
"NO WAY" Anderson exclaimed suddenly, making his chair spin wildly as he shot up from it in shock.
"Yep, we win the bet" Greg smacked his hand together a look of pure delight lighting up his face making him look 5 years younger.
"They are together?" Sally was also standing now her chocolate hobnob forgotten halfway to her mouth.
"Yeah, John told me just now, said "to keep it quiet"" lestrade let out a small chuckle as he mimed air quotes.
Jake let out a massive booming laugh that carried even over the hum of voices now filling the small room "I've got to text Dimock, he'll be so pissed he's got to buy us a drink after all these years.
"Wonder how long they're going to stay together" Anderson muttered under his breath, a scowl plastered on his face as he crossed his arms.
The new girl Ruth (well, new in comparison to the rest of them) stood up too, she was happily bouncing on the balls of her feet "Don't be so negative Anderson, they've practically been together for 3 years now. You're just salty because you've lost, speaking of which, I'll have a pint of strongbow please"
