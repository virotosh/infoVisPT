The Adventures of Emma Holmes
Suddenly, a plucky young woman walked up to the door of 221 Baker Street. She had a special reason for seeing the famous detective.
"Just a minute!" exclaimed Sherlock. He rushed to get his coat, then opened the door.
"Yes?" he said.
"Hi! I'm your daughter, Emma" she said, giving the consulting detective a very awkward hug.
"You have a daughter?" said John.
"Funny you should ask. I had an affair in college when I was about nineteen," he said.
"You? Having an affair? In college?"
"Look, John, we all do crazy things in college," he said. "Ah, yes, now I remember- a lovely young woman by the name of Louisa Hawkins."
"Yeah, about her? She died," said Emma.
"She what?" exclaimed Sherlock.
"She got sick and died. Of something."
"She really is your daughter," said John.
Sherlock said nothing, but merely stared at him.
"You know, as a matter of fact, I myself also have a daughter," he replied.
"Really?" said Sherlock.
"Absolutely. She's about your daughter's age, her name is Indica. I guess they could be friends."
"I see."
Emma was too busy looking at the books on Sherlock's dusty bookshelf to even care.
"Woah, look at all the cool books here!" she exclaimed. She then took out a copy of a Civil War diary. "Oh my gosh, her name is Emma Holmes too!"
"Well, I guess you could take a look here at my study," said Sherlock, staring down at his daughter. "But whatever you do, don't be in the vicinity of Daddy when he's bored."
"Why not?" said Emma.
"You'reâ€¦.not going to like him when he's bored," said John. "He's...different when he's bored."
"Oh."
