Hello beloved readers,
Due to some technicalities and news yet to be shared, 
 will be moved solely to Wattpad for one calendar year beginning November 1, 2021. If you wish to continue reading the story or would like to re-read it in the future, please head over to my Wattpad profile to read it there. My user name is missholmes-of-gondor and my name is posted as Emily Betts. I do apologize for any inconvenience, but please know 
 will return to FF net on November 1, 2022. Thank you for your support, and I look forward to seeing you on Wattpad!
Yours,
Emily :)
