"Sherlock?" Mrs. Hudson poked her head around the door.
"Yes, what do you want?" the consulting detective mumbled back.
"I was cleaning out downstairs," she began, "and I found this." She handed Sherlock a thick pile of papers and tried together. "It's addressed to you."
"I see. Thank you," Sherlock replied, taking it. He sat back down in his chair and leafed through the papers.
he thought, recognizing his scrawl, and began to read the first one:
 Sherlock realized. He picked up the next one.
Sherlock stopped reading. He couldn't read anymore. He groaned and put his head in his hands. How could he have done this to his best friend?
John stepped into the room, pausing when he saw Sherlock.
"You alright there?"
"Oh, John, I'm so sorry," Sherlock whispered.
"For what?" John asked before spotting the letters on the table in front of him.
"You found those?" he said, his voice lowering unconsciously.
"I never meant for you to read those, I mean, obviously you couldn't, because you were supposedly dead and they were just to keep my therapist from bothering me too much," he rambled.
"I should've told you I was alive, I mean, I did drop you a hint but you never picked up on it."
"What?"
"I said, 'It's all a magic trick, just a magic trick...'"
"Whatever, look, Sherlock, that was ages ago. It's alright, I forgave you already." John reassured him.
Sherlock looked up, his eyes shining with unshed tears. "What I did, it was unforgivable, John. I don't deserveâ€¦"
John got up and cut his friend off with a hug. He felt Sherlock tense but then slowly relax into the embrace.
"It's okay," he soothed, not really knowing what else to say.
"No it's not," Sherlock sniffled back.
John hesitated, remembering his last embrace with Sherlock after Mary died, and his response:
"No. But it is what it is."
