"Ultra Infirmitatibus Meis"
Prologue
"Just the family dog."
"
!"
Hearing his mother's condescending voice echo in his ears, Mycroft opened his blurry eyes only to discover he's no longer in his favorite seat in the Diogenes Club trying to focus on anything else but the aftermath of previous events, but on the cold floor of his Mind Palace, where all the thoughts he tried not to dwell on are free to assault him.
It seems that even his own brain agrees that no good deed should go unpunished.
Even ones it itself concluded were for the greater good.
Groaning the older Homes brother closed his eyes again, memories of his encounter with his parents flooding his ever-remembering mind.
He remembered it like it was yesterday…
The way they looked at him with pure disgust in their eyes…the way they immediately jumped to Eurus's protection, not even 
 about hearing his side of the story…
The way they seemed to both degrade and disown him with 
 hesitation…
Was what Mummy Holmes said, but Mycroft also heard the part that was left silent but no less insulting.
"
"
A lump grew in his throat and his heart began to hurt.
He tried to tell himself that he was ready for this, that he expected this reaction ever since Uncle Rudi trusted him with his secret, that taking all the blame and hate was 
 part of the plan.
The 'Ice-man' façade was created and perfected throughout the ages in wait for this very moment.
So that, when they finally learn of his treachery, he'll be able to take their hate no matter how much they threw at him and still look as if they were discussing the weather, even if on the inside he was tearing apart.
He made himself think that the knowledge of everyone else being safe will be worth every harsh glare, every cutting insult…
He lived so long with Sherlock and his gang hating his very existence, only contacting him when absolutely necessary and otherwise treating him like dirt, adapting to his parents not wishing to see him anymore shouldn't be a problem.
His family is safe, that's 
 that matters.
But…
Those are lies, aren't they?
He 
 ready for all this, no matter how hard he tried to pretend he was.
He 
expected that, after 
 he did: making sure his little brother was never in harm's way for all these years, taking on the responsibility that 
 should have barred from an early age, and generally being the reliable son, they'd just disregard 
 of that at the drop of the hat the moment they heard of what he did to Eurus.
The Ice-man is just that, a 
. It might work when he's dealing with presidents, queens and other foreign officials but...it always melts away when his family is involved, proving itself to be completely useless when he needs it most. 
He 
 he was strong enough to be the monster of the family that's never acknowledged for anything 
 the mistakes he's made, but he 
…
Mycroft may have fooled everyone else, but he never could quite fool 
.
And his heart could barely stand the thought of his little brother despising him, adding the rest of his family to the list would do nothing short of destroying it…
The elder Holmes's face constricted in pain along with the organ that betrayed him most.
What he did was very hurtful and he knew that, he also knew that their anger is very much justified and that he deserved every bit of it…
What he 
 understand however was their complete 
 of will to so much as 
 to him.
Did they really think he would lock his sibling up in a mental hospital without a solid reason?
Where did all that mistrust come from?
What did he do to deserve it?
He doesn't…doesn't understand…
…
...
...Perhaps he really 
 limited?
Without even realizing it Mycroft Homes curled into a ball, hugging his knees like a child does after a nightmare, something he hasn't done in literal 
.
He was always too old for that…even when he was 
…
Good Big brothers don't cry, don't get scared…don't get overwhelmed by responsibilities…
...don't lock their mentally unstable little sisters in prisons when nothing else worked…
Good big brothers don't do those thigs…
…yet he 
.
And would probably do so 
 if he had to.
Because 
 has to make the hard choices.
And there is 
 no-one else.
His parents are incapable of doing so to their own child...
Sherlock can barely take care of himself...
And Uncle Rudi is 
.
"
." A voice somewhere above the elder Holmes sighted, breaking him out of his ponderings. 
 
The owner of the voice snorted in obvious disgust. 
Mycroft closed his eyes and swore quite ferociously under his breath.
"Why," He started, teeth gritted and eyes closed in silent frustration. "out of 
 who took residence in this palace…Why is it 
 
?"
The man in question shared a disturbing similarity to him, dare he say that he could have passed as a long-lost twin.
He was tall, dressed in an impeccable dark-blue suit, had short auburn colored curls and had the same ice-cold pale-blue eyes Mycroft himself had.
But that's where the similarities ended.
For the man looked like a corpse taken freshly out of the freezer. His clothes and hair covered in a layer of frost, eyes cold and lacking the healthy glow they usually have, his skin white and looking chilling to the touch, his chest sporting a large black hole where his heart should have been.
He was the person who everyone saw Mycroft Holmes as…who he was 
to be.
The dead man that walks.
The Iceman.
Said man with skin colder than the harshest winter and wind, smiled a mirthless smile before replying.
"
He then spread his arms as if to show off the space around him. "
"That is 
 my point." Sherlock's older brother sneered from the ground. "I 
 want you here, and yet you 
 grace me with your presence."
The fragment of imagination had the nerve to shrug.
"
" It smiled again, this time showing off pearly-white teeth. "
"
"Because, like my brother, you have made a habit of ignoring everything I say." Mycroft replied irritated, pushing himself to a kneeing position.
"
." The icy tone turned from condescending to serious. "
"
"What you proposed couldn't be done." Sherlock's brother whispered, shaking his fox-colored head.
"
" The Iceman said, his tone knowing as he twirled his frost covered brolly.
"It would never work." Mycroft's voice was barely a whisper. "You know this. We tried countless times. It never lasted."
Suddenly he was forced to his back by a sharp tip of an umbrella pressing on his Adams apple with alarming strength, nearly chocking him.
"
" The Iceman didn't scream, yet his voice was harsh enough to have a similar effect. 
"I don't have the luxury to do so." Mycroft whispered, ignoring the blade pressed to his neck. "I have to keep them safe…"
"
" The Iceman sneered. 
"They don't treat me like a-" Mycroft started to argue but the metal tip of the umbrella pressed down on his vocal cord, preventing any sounds from escaping.
The colder man asked, his voice icy and devoid of any emotion. "
."
Even if he wanted to, Mycroft couldn't answer, the damned thing still was pressing on his throat.
"
"
Mycroft remained quiet, each word stabbing a knife into his already bruised heart.
"
." The Iceman continued, he then lifted the umbrella off of the other man's exposed neck. "
"
"They were right to be angry with me." Mycroft whispered as if his throat was blocked by something, his back still pressed to the cold floor. His pale-blue eyes stared emptily at nothing. "I took their child away and locked her up away from sociality."
The Iceman stepped into his field of vision and crouched so that the beaten man's attention was on him.
"
" A hand that was supposed to be sympathetic but really wasn't because of obvious reasons, was placed on his shoulder. "
."
"My best wasn't enough." Mycroft wheezed out, heart hurting more with each beat it took. "It's 
 enough."
The Iceman's eyes darkened again, he squeezed the shoulder he was holding.
"
." He said, voice softer in tone. "
."
"They're doing that now, aren't they?" Came the weak response. "Finding a way to bring Eurus back… together…as a family." Mycroft swallowed the lump that threatened to choke him, the pain in his chest growing. "Without me…"
This time the Iceman stayed silent, having nothing to say.
"Mummy and Daddy have Sherlock to rely on now…" The Shadow behind the United Kingdom continued, eyes bright as if finally freed of a fog that blocked their view. "They don't 
 me anymore, except to gain access to Sherrinford…" He then covered his face with his hands, his body shaking with unreleased sobs and the normally steady voice breaking. "
…you're right…
are you 
 right?"
"
." The man covered in frost stated coolly, watching with expressionless eyes as the man before him sobbed quietly into his hands, his heart literally leaking blood onto the suit.
This was too much…Everything…Sherlock's overdoses, Mary's death, Magnussen, Sherrinford…the overbearing guilt, the 
 pain, the sheer 
…it all piled up and hit him like a tsunami wave, leaving nothing but anguish behind.
He couldn't take this anymore.
So he did something he hadn't done since he was a toddler.
He cried.
After he saw the man on the floor cry his soul out for a good minute, the fragmentation though enough was enough, and reached out his right hand, gently touching Mycroft's chest just over the bleeding organ.
A soft hitch in breath could be heard, along with a small flinch, from the injured man, as the heart began to freeze under his icy touch, and when the Iceman looked towards Mycroft's face he noticed that it wasn't covered by his hands anymore. Instead it stared at nothing, eyes cloudy and tear stains marking his cheeks and eyelids.
"
" He spoke softly, fully aware that his touch is effectively dulling said man's thinking process. "
" The Iceman paused. "
" He took a deep breath before continuing. "
" He then locked his icy-cold eyes with fox-haired man's foggy ones. "
"
But Mycroft was too far gone to thing straight right now.
He just wanted the pain to end.
"P-Please…" He wheezed out. "Make it…stop."
Hearing this the Iceman nodded.
"
."
He then pushed his hand inside Mycroft's chest completely ignoring fabric flesh and bones, making the laying man gasp, his freezing touch making quick work of the warm pulsing organ, swiftly turning it into a small block of ice.
In normal circumstances, this is where the procedure would end.
But this time…it was only the first phase.
Feeling the heart solidify under his fingertips, the Iceman narrowed his eyes in determination before letting his hand grab it like a ball and then…
.
Mycroft's eyes unfocused and became even foggier, while his body shook, this time from the inside cold the heart left behind.
Satisfied, the Iceman pulled his hand out and watched as a black hole not dissimilar to his own formed on the left side of the elder Holmes's broad chest.
Phase two complete. Now for phase three.
This time the icy fragmentation of Mycroft's psyche stood up, leaving the barely conscious Mycroft to rest, and made his way towards the various rooms in the Palace.
Reaching the one he was looking for he opened the large, rusty door.
Inside a baby Mycroft Holmes was being hugged by his mother and cooed at by his father.
It was the day he was born.
Back when everything was simpler and his parents actually loved him.
"
" The Iceman said sternly, waving his hand. "
" Reacting to the man's voice, the room started changing. "
."
Mr. and Mrs. Holmes were no longer in the room, instead a young doctor was trying to calm down the terrified baby Mycroft, admits a horrifying looking car crash, who was covered in cuts and bruises but was otherwise unharmed.
"
"
Again the scene changed, this time the tiny Mycroft was being surrounded by concerned looking nurses, some worrying over his injuries while others scattered to prepare a fresh bottle of milk and a pair of new clothes for him.
The Iceman nodded, accepting what he saw and moving on to add the final touches.
The rest of Mycroft's memories will adjust themselves accordingly during the night, he just needs to feed the palace details.
"
."
Seeing everything fall into place, he turned to the now sleeping Mycroft Holmes and whispered before disappearing.
"
