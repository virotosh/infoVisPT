"Mummy, why are you bringing two strange children to live with us tomorrow?" seven year old Sherlock Holmes asked his mother as she hustled about the parlour. "Aren't Mycroft and I enough?"
"Sherlock darling, of course you two are enough."
Mother Holmes sat on the sofa and pulled the small, curly haired boy up next to her.
"We have enough money to give John and Harriet a good upbringing and it seemed selfish not to do a thing about their situation."
"They don't have a mum or a dad of their own to care for them?"
"No Sherlock, they don't."
This shocked the boy, causing his grey-blue eyes to widen. It took him a little while to believe that children could live without parents to love them.
"Well, why did you make me figure out all by myself instead of telling me?" Sherlock huffed after a moment.
"I was going to tell you and Mycroft about it at tea dear. You're just too clever," Mrs. Holmes encouraged while ruffling the young boy's hair. "Speaking of tea, it's about that time, won't you call your brother for me?"
"Yes mum."
Sherlock jumped off the couch, rushed out of the room and clattered up the stairs. Upon reaching Mycroft's room, the boy knocked loudly.
"What is it Sherlock?" Mycroft's lazy voice seeped under the door
"It's tea time!"
"Alright, give me a moment to straighten up."
Sherlock waited impatiently until the door opened and the tall 13 year old stepped out with a yawn. Together, the boys went down to have tea with their mother.
