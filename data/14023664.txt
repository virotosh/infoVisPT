Sherlock was bored. No business, nothing. But there was John and Rosie. He considered them part of his family, even if he would never admit it. Five years earlier, he had been pleasantly surprised when John and Rosie (then six months old) had appeared in his home. His best friend, teammate and former roommate had asked him if he could move back to 221B Baker Street with his adorable daughter. He had accepted eagerly, although surprised because he still felt responsible for Mary's death and had apologized to her. John assured him that it was nothing, telling him that it was life, that there was nothing we could do about it, that it had been his wife's choice and assured him that he had moved on.
So, Rosie had grown up with an insufferable godfather, his fads, his damn chemical experiments according to his wonderful real dad and organs in the fridge. And today, Sherlock tells himself that to be definitively forgiven, he would please his beautiful, adored goddaughter. So, when he told Rosamund to go to his room, he changed and went down to the living room.
