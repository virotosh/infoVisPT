Never once did Sherlock think his last moments would be with john, lying on a sidewalk, and holding his hand while the two bled out, but he always knew it'd be with john by his side.
"John..." He said, a pathetic tone in his voice John had never once heard before. "Sherlock... Shut up. You're going to be fine." John grabbed Sherlocks hand tighter as he spoke, yet he knew the words he spoke were only mere lies.
"Sherlock please dont give up on me" He cried. "You're going to be okay." Sherlock reached up to john and grabbed his face with a smile. "Listen to me, please." He said, his voice breaking which broke john. "Don't ever forget what i tell you. no matter what happens, I want you to go on like normal."
"I'm going to be able to continue on normally because your going to be okay." John told him. "No, I'm not, and you need to accept that." John didnt want to accept what Sherlock told him, but in the back of his mind, he knew he was right. He winced at the stinging pain of the knife wound in his side, as the adrenaline wore off, yet ignored it as it bled through his shirt, staining it.
He lay next to sherlock on his side, holding his hand tighter. "Sherlock?" He asked. Sherlock didnt respond. His hands went limp in John's grasp, as John realized his eyes had shut and he lay limp on the ground. "No, Sherlock, answer me..." He cried out, weakening by the second as he use his remaining strength to attempt to shake him awake. "Please.." He wailed. A few tears streamed down his face and dripped on the ground as he came to reality.
He turned back onto his back, still holding Sherlock's hand in his own. he closed his eyes, relaxing best he could as he tried to ignore the stabbing pain in his side. His tears dried in his face, leaving slightly visible stains on his face as he lied next to his friend. "We were born to die." He said, as a slight grin appeared on his face, yet soon disappeared as he went limp on the cold pavement under them.
