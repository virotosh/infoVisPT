DI Lestrade is sick of the bickering so decides to force his department on a team building session as well as attempting to make the police forces reputation better.
It just happens to be in the form of BakeOff.

Author note
Trying to write an actual short story, and decided let's write a crack/humor piece. Enjoy my dears, as I most certainly had fun writing this. Until the next one!
——
"SHERLOCK MY BATTER IS ON THE TENT CEILING" Bellowed Anderson.
"THAT IS YOUR FAULT FOR MAKING SUCH A BORING RECIPE, I HAD TO MAKE IT INTERESTING SOMEHOW" Yelled back Sherlock.
"CAN YOU BOTH SHUT UP I CAN'T FOCUS ON PIPING MY FUCKING ICING" Screamed the Scotland Yard Chief, which due to threats of not being let back in the house by his formidable wife had "decided" to join the homicide team on their team building day in the Bake Off tent.
Perhaps it wasn't the best idea to make the most competitive, Type A personality group to compete in something none of them were actually good at. No skill coupled with an abundance of energy and emotion could only mean chaos.
The man behind this team building trip gave no shits. He had already blackmailed/bribed the BBC to edit everything so it would be more favourable, therefore making him feel completely ok with him cussing out his doughnut cake shaped, silicone mold like it was its fault that he forgot to butter it.
WACK*
"WHAT THE FUCK DONAVAN, I HAVE DONE NOTHING TO YOU TODAY" Yelled John with a red velvet cake running down his face.
"SORRY SATAN'S NEW DISCIPLE, I WAS AIMING FOR THE FREAK FOR BLOWING UP ANDERSONS CAKE BATTER…However literally vanilla the cake is" Replied Donavan, becoming a bit sheepish at the end.
"SEE, EVEN SHE AGREES AND SHE IS SOCIALLY OBLIGATED TO AGREE WITH YOU" Yelled back Sherlock, whilst dealing with smoke coming out of his bowl.
"Is there supposed to be that much liquid nitrogen?" Said a soundman clearly disturbed about the fact that the tent was becoming like an Arctic tundra.
"MY REMAINING BATTER HAS BECOME ROCK SOLID THANKS SHERLOCK, IF I GET LAST PLACE I'M NOT GIVING YOU AN CASES REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR BROTHER SAYS" Shouted Lestrade.
Clearly at this point though, none of the footage was useable and so the very tired, overworked and underpaid crew, left the tent.
Naturally no one noticed. Despite the fact they are literally detectives.
"AS YOU WILL SEE, THERE IS A REASON I RUN THE ROOST" The Chief said, lifting his mediocre cake for the world to see.
Then promptly dropping it.
"WHEEEEYYYY" Collectively said the only human life forms remaining in the tent. Perhaps pre-gaming before filming wasn't a great idea, but then again neither was any of this.
The Chief, about to take the rest of the eggs and throwing them at his subordinates, looked up with a look like deer in the headlights.
"Well, hello Chief. What a pleasure to be seeing you again. I am here to collect my partner and apparently here to ensure the reputation of one of the finest establishments in the UK is preserved, the police" An impeccably well dressed man said, seemingly appearing out of nowhere.
"BOOOOOOO" Said Sherlock, both due to the chemical chaos ending and also because of the overly fond description of the police.
"BYE LOSERS, SEE YOU ON MONDAY, HAVE FUN GETTING GLITTER OUT OF EVERYTHING" Lestrade yelled.
"Huh?" Everyone said.
Then Lestrade in all his glory took out the edible glitter and strut out of the tent whilst throwing it at his colleagues (and boss).
"Really Gregory, was that all necessary?" Mycroft asked, bemused but not surprised.
"Nothing unites coppers like alcohol and cake! Also the team are less stressed and only want to kill each other over icing and not bodies!" Replied Lestrade as his strutting turned to sauntering as he draped his arm around his partner.
"Also glitter too my dear" Chuckled Mycroft fondly.
"Yeah I mean you would know right?" Asked Lestrade cheekily.
"Pardon?"
"HAPPY TEAM BUILDING" Yelled Lestrade pouring glitter down Mycroft's overly expensive 3 piece suit.
So, that is the story of how our favorite Government official got coated with pink glitter and an insight into how our favorite DI keeps the best department is Scotland Yard together.

I was actually sober writing this, how about that.
Also envisioning Mycroft still having pink glitter on him during a Top Secret meeting with world leaders. Hehe.
How fun.
