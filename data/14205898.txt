I walk into the drawing room of Sherlock's flat, blanket wrapped around my shoulders and quietly dragging behind me. He sits in his black arm chair with an astronomy book in his hands, and a steaming cup of tea on the end table beside him. He doesn't look up, but I know he speaks to me nonetheless. "Is there something you need?" I nod my head, and he closes his book softly and finely looks up at me, observing me with care and interest. "You're shaking…Are you cold?" I hesitate before lying and nodding yes. "Let me start a fire, you can sit in front-" I shake my head.
"Could you just…hold me? Please?" An understanding dawned in his bright eyes and he nodded before taking my hand and sitting on the couch with me. He slowly puts his arm around my shoulder, awkward and hesitant. I sink into him almost immediately, letting out a shaky sigh. His brow furrows, feeling how violently I am shaking despite the warmth I have. As I started to silently sob, he fully understood and pulled me into a loose hug. "Shh, it's alright. You'll be alright, darling. Why are you crying? What's wrong?" I stilled for a second before I gave in, letting all my worries, stress, grief and insecurities flow out of me.
"I'm so scared, I don't know what I'd do if they came back. I keep having nightmares of having to face them."
"I'm so sorry…" Is all he whispered as he hugged me tighter. I nodded, grateful for being able to talk about it and have someone that understood. He felt so warm wrapped around me and I inhaled his scent. A little smile dared its way onto my face and I let it stay there as he pulled me back to lay down on the couch with him.
