What happens when scotland yard finds out that sherlock and john are married and have a Son, how will they feel when they meet Hamish Mycroft Holmes - Watson, when he looks just like Sherlock but is more like John.
OK so I love Johnlock and I haven't made an Oc yet so I decided to write this, the adventures of Hamish Holmes and his Father's Sherlock holmes and john watson hope you like it.
I might add in a crossover with the avengers, with tony as a secret Holmes brother.
