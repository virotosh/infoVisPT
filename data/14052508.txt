"What happened to the lipstick? You had lipstick on before!"
I received quite the side-eye for my words, followed by a shrug and a brief, "It wasn't working for me."
I couldn't help my response; the words left my mouth before I could stop them. "Really? I thought it was a big improvement. Your mouth's too small now."
Sherlock turned and gave me a scowl. "Very funny, Molly. I'm going undercover, not entering a drag contest -"
"A shame, because I'm having quite a lot of fun dragging you!" I quipped.
For this I received another scowl and a Mycroft-worthy eyeroll. "Don't tell jokes, Molly, they're really notâ€¦as bad as I pretend they are," he finished with a grin.
I grinned back appreciatively. "Well, if we're revisiting your past sins," I said lightly, "then perhaps you'd like to comment on my breasts next? Or," I added, eyeing his temporarily altered profile, "perhaps I should comment on yours!"
He glanced down at himself, then back at me. "Hmm, yes, well, don't get used to them, they'll be gone by the time I get home tonight." He waggled his eyebrows at me. "Unless you'd rather I kept them on?"
I pretended to consider the matter, then shook my head. "Nah, if we wanted an extra pair of breasts in bed with us I'm sure Irene Adler would be willing."
He gave a mock shudder. "Good lord, woman, when I married you I thought you took the 'forsaking all others' bit as seriously as I did!"
Then he gathered me into his arms, fake breasts squashing up against mine, and kissed me. I of course kissed him back with a great deal of enthusiasm, so much so that he tottered a bit on his high-heels, but managed NOT to fall on his gorgeous arse with me on top of him.
More's the pity!
