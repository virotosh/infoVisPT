Just a very short one-shot I wrote recently. No romance, no pairings, just a quick blurb. Enjoy!
The late afternoon sun stretched long shadows across the small, nondescript house, where officers moved methodically, their voices blending with the crackle of police radios. The crime scene was routine for most, but the air buzzed with the tension that always lingers when questions outnumber answers. Amidst the controlled chaos, a new face pushed through the crowd with an air of unwarranted self-importance.
Detective Constable Briggs had only recently joined the Yard, but his attitude suggested that he already believed himself to be a cut above the rest. His appearance, a mix of unkempt hair and a crumpled suit, spoke of someone who didn't particularly care to make a good impression—at least, not on his colleagues.
He strode past Sherlock and John, and barely spared them a glance, his expression dismissive. He had no time for what he considered amateurs, even if they were legends in their own right.
As he approached a cluster of officers, his gaze landed on Sergeant Donovan, who was issuing orders with her usual efficiency. There was something in his eyes—a hint of disdain, perhaps, or something darker—that sharpened when he looked at her.
Noticing his approach, Donovan met his gaze coolly. "Briggs, good to see you've finally joined us. I make it a point to be first on the scene."
Briggs paused, a smirk curling at the corner of his lips, before he spoke loud enough for those nearby to hear.
"And yet, the black diversity hire can't make it past Sergeant!" he said with a chuckle, his eyes flicking disdainfully toward Sergeant Donovan.
Donovan's back stiffened, the sting of the remark cutting through her composed exterior. She narrowed her eyes but held her tongue, opting for professionalism over retaliation.
John, who had been standing nearby, felt a surge of anger at the casual cruelty of the remark. But before he could react, before he could even process what was happening, Sherlock was already moving.
In a swift, fluid motion, Sherlock was at Briggs's side, his hand gripping the detective's collar. With surprising force, he slammed Briggs against the wall of the house, the impact echoing through the yard, freezing everyone in place and silencing the hum of activity around them.
"How very dare you," Sherlock's voice was low, almost a whisper, but the fury in it was unmistakable. His eyes bored into Briggs's, the quiet outrage simmering just beneath the surface of his usual calm exterior. "I have my banter with the good Sergeant, and she with me, but never would I stoop so low as to remark on her race. Your filthy words aren't just offensive; they're utterly disgraceful."
Briggs's arrogance evaporated instantly, replaced by a look of fear as he found himself pinned under Sherlock's intense gaze. The smirk that had so recently adorned his face was long gone, leaving only wide, frightened eyes.
Lestrade, having noticed the commotion from across the yard, started towards them, but John held him back with a subtle shake of his head. This was not something to interrupt.
Briggs spluttered, trying to find his voice, but Sherlock cut him off, tightening his grip slightly. "Apologize. Now."
The demand was simple, but the weight behind it was undeniable. Briggs's eyes darted toward Donovan, who was watching the scene unfold with a mixture of shock and disbelief.
"I-I'm sorry, Donovan," Briggs stammered, barely managing to get the words out.
Sherlock's expression didn't soften. " 
 Donovan," he corrected icily.
"I'm s-sorry, Sergeant Donovan!" Briggs repeated, his voice cracking under the pressure.
Sherlock released him abruptly, and Briggs nearly collapsed to the ground. Sherlock then turned his gaze to Donovan, his eyes softening just enough to convey a genuine concern beneath his anger.
"Are you satisfied with the apology, Sergeant?" Sherlock's tone was measured, yet his intensity lingered.
Donovan, still reeling from the sudden turn of events, managed a faint nod, her gaze flickering between Sherlock and the now-cowering Briggs.
"Very good then," Sherlock said, his voice settling back into its usual calm. He turned on his heel and strode into the house with an air of casual nonchalance, as though the commotion had never happened.
Lestrade looked between Sherlock's retreating form and the disheveled Briggs. "What the bloody hell just happened?" he asked, his confusion evident.
"Nothing, Detective Inspector," Donovan said, her voice carrying a tone of steely composure as she looked down at Briggs. "Just the new guy learning the ropes."
Lestrade let out a breath. "Must've been some rope. I've never seen Sherlock so pissed off before."
John went to follow Sherlock inside. "Everyone has their trigger, I suppose."
The atmosphere in the room was thick with the aftermath of Sherlock's confrontation. Donovan stood off to the side, still trying to process the unexpected defense. She watched as Sherlock casually surveyed the crime scene, his earlier outrage now replaced by his characteristic focus. After a moment, she took a breath and approached him.
"Why'd you do that?" Donovan asked quietly, her voice almost hesitant.
Sherlock glanced at her in genuine confusion. "Do what?"
"Stand up for me like that. We don't exactly get along—"
"Personality conflicts and hating you for your skin color are hardly comparable ideas."
Donovan stared at him, her mouth working soundlessly for a moment before she found her voice. "No, I suppose they aren't."
Sherlock's gaze softened just a fraction, though his tone remained clinical. "I'm aware that you find me rude, freakish, and quite possibly the most annoying person you've ever met. But I hardly think hatred is part of the equation."
Donovan's expression was a mix of surprise and reluctant acceptance. "No, I don't hate you. But yes, you are all of those things."
Sherlock's lips curled into a faint, self-assured smile. "Naturally, I have to maintain my reputation," he said with a wink. "Now, if you're not going to make any useful contributions to the investigation, please do step out of the room."
Donovan's jaw dropped momentarily, but she managed to regain her composure. She closed her mouth firmly, fighting back a sharp retort. Instead, she gestured toward the crime scene with a resigned sigh. "Alright then, why don't you enlighten me with what 
 found?"
Sherlock's face lit up with genuine enthusiasm as he turned to her. "Gladly!" he said, his eyes sparkling with the excitement of the investigation. He began pointing out details with a fervor that made Donovan's previous grievances seem distant and irrelevant.
As Sherlock delved into his observations, Donovan stood quietly, absorbing his insights. The tension between them lessened the slightest bit, replaced by a reluctant appreciation for Sherlock's unorthodox but undeniably sharp intellect.
And his unwavering sense of justice.
Hope you liked it! I love reviews, even if it's just your favorite word in the story!
