John had never really minded Sherlock's violin. Most of the time, he played beautiful melodies that filled the whole flat.
He did, however, mind when Sherlock began to play at odd hours in the morning. He would groan and bury his head under a pillow until it ceased. But otherwise, it was lovely.

"Glad to see you're awake," Sherlock remarked wryly. John mumbled back, and lay back down.
