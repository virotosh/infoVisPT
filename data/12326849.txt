When the tales and legends we know now were actual truth, before humans feared what people today would call mythical beasts and creatures: Fairies, dwarves, elves, centaurs, merpeople, the Phoenix, unicorns, and the revered dragons.
Humans lived in platonic harmony with these great beasts and creatures; one species not interfering with another, but every so often, whether it be planned or happenstance, different species would collide.
Those instances were few and far between, the only thing that remained from those episodes were the stories, ones that would become today's greatest legends.
Humans and other species lived with their fellow kind, not any one kind wanting to stir up chaos in a peace time. Humans had reign over places habitual for them (this was long before the era of dispersion, humans needed not to turn uninhabitable places in habitual ones).
Because of the enormity of the list creatures, I cannot begin to say where said creatures lived but will leave that up to imagination.
The story I want to tell you is one that caused the decline of a great race. It is not one of legend. Many people today have tried to find a theory to explain the cause of the decline, all of them are but fantasy. My story, though it sound as such, is not one of man's conjured, whimsical thoughts but of pure truth, passed down with meticulous care, generation to generation. It surpasses some of the most greatest stories you'd have ever been told.
Listen, for never has one of your kind ever heard this story.
My story begins, as most stories do, with Once Upon a Time...
