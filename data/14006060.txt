I walk between and around them. The grey stones-why always that color?-grey. Considering why I'm here again. Why today? I know damn well why! But I don't want to admit it!
Two years it is since-my heart ups it beat, nearing the one-the place.
The headstone that marks his-demise! But wait, stopping just at the tail of the mound, wait! Why haven't I noticed this before? Or has my grief shadowed my logic all this time? These two years!
I regard his name carved into the rough stone, then register a significant portion missing. It's the combination of words and numbers that are usually made under the persons' name.
As the puzzle unravels in my brain, my deduction becomes understood, I swallow heavily. Then, wiping my brow with my handkerchief, my eyes tear up-not in the sorrow as expected but in joyous rapture.
For some unknown reason, his end date is not there on that cold stone, which leads me to one conclusion.
He's alive!
At first, I grow angry-a wave of deep anger washes over me.
And with the clarity that he's taught me, I begin to realize-to understand.
He's protecting me. Guarding me against a particular situation I am not currently aware of, but one that never the less would lead to my death.
But why wouldn't he have explained this-given me a clue?
He knows me so well. Knows that I could never mourn in such a way as to make it realistic. Real enough so that my and maybe even his malefactor would swallow the lie.
Which means, bless him, I have to continue the charade. Pulling myself together, holding tight to my jacket, I pitch forward, my forehead drooping onto the stone. I weep, I sob.
To the outsider, a watcher, I'm deeply in grief, but my sobs are one of exhilaration.
My fingers trail over the engraved letters as though they were touching his heart.
Be patient.
For you now know, his most profound concern is for your safety.
It's written in the unwritten.
