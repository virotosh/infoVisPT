John's phone could be heard ringing, and it'd woken him up. He answered. "Oh, Oh my god, What?" He stood up and began anxiously pacing around the room. "Is she okay? Okay, Im coming." He hung up the phone and turned to sherlock. "Ms. Hudson's been shot. Come on, we need to-" He was cut off by Sherlock. "You go, I'm busy." His response was returned by both an angry and shocked look from John. "You once nearly killed a man for laying a finger one her!" he paused for a moment." Sod this. She's dying you machine!" John stormed off, still panicking. Once he'd left, a text showed up on Sherlock's phone.

Sherlock opened the door the the rooftop, to find moriarty sitting on a ledge, his phone playing 'stayin alive.'
"Well" Moriarty paused for a moment. "Here we are at last." Sherlock continued to walk up to Moriarty, without speaking a word to him. "You and me Sherlock." This time Jim only paused a brief moment, before starting up again. "And our problem, the final problem," he held up uis phone, still playing the music. "Stayin' Alive!" he quoted. "So boring, isnt it?" He stopped the music abruptly. "Its just... staying. All my life i've been searching for a distraction." Sherlock paced around the area slowly. "You were the best distraction and now i dont even have you, because i've beaten you." Sherlock now looked at Jim, and paused in his pacing. "And you know what? In the end it was easy." Jim added. Sherlock clasped his hands behind his back, and texted john only a single sentence. 'Vatican cameos.' "It was easy. Now i've got to go back to playing with the ordinary people, yet turns out your ordinary just like all of them." Jim put his face in his hands, whilst Sherlock glared at him from above. "Did you almost start to wonder if I was real?" Moriarty was standing now, and circling Sherlock as if a shark around wounded prey. Sherlock watched him circle him, yet ceased to move. "Did i nearly get ya?" despite the tense situation, Moriarty kept a cheery tone. "Richard Brook." Sherlock started. "Nobody seems to get the joke, but you do." Moriarty added. "Of course. Rich Brook is german is Reichenbach. The case that made my name." Sherlock spoke, finally speaking an entire sentence. "Just tryna have some fun" Moriarty said, yet this time in a childish voice. "You always want everything to be clever, Now shall we finish the game? One final act. Glad you chose a tall building." he paused briefly. "Nice way to do it" Sherlock didnt look at Jim. "Do it? Do... Do what?" Neither of the two men spoke to break the silence. "Yes, of course. My suicide."

John made it back to the flats, and bumped into Ms Hudson. "Is everything okay now, with the police? Has sherlock sorted it all out?" She asked. Suddenly, a delayed ping could be heard from his phone. Two words from Sherlock was all it took. "Vatican cameos." He put his phone away, and looked back up at Ms hudson. "Oh my god.." He once again burst out the door and frantically called for a cab to take him back to the hospital. A long and arduous cab ride was ahead, so John used that time to track sherlock's phone.
Finally when he'd arrived back in the spot where he'd left him and realized Sherlock had left, he began frantically searching every room, before realized a door to the rooftop had been left open. It hadnt been left open before, So he raced up the stairs, fueled purely like adrenaline.

"I can still prove you created an entirely false identity." Sherlock said, visibly more frustrated. "Oh just kill yourself, its a lot less effort." Moriarty responded. "Go on. For me." There was a brief moment of silence, where only cars were heard. "Pleeaaseee?" Jim begged, in a high pitched voice. Sherlock lunged at him, grabbing him by the collar of his coat and holding him above the ledge. "You're insane." Sherlock stated. "Your just getting that now?" Moriarty responded, purely to frustrate sherlock even more. He shoved him more, threatening to drop him off. "Whoa! Okay.. Let me give you a little extra incentive. Your friends will die if you dont." Sherlock looked shocked at this statement. "John?" He asked. "Not just john, everyone. Three bullets, three gunmen, three victims, theres no stopping them now." Sherlock released Moriarty, and planted him on his feet abruptly. "Unless my people see you jump. You can have me arrested. You can torture me, but nothings going to prevent them from pulling the trigger." Sherlock stood there, refusing to even look at Jim. "Your only three friends in the world will die, unless-" He was cut off by sherlock. "Unless I kill myself, complete your story, and I die in disgrace." "Look, you've got an audience now. Off you pop!" Moriarty was enjoying frustrating and angering Sherlock more and more every second. "I told you how this ends. Your death is the only thing thats going to call off the killers. I'm certainly not going to do it." He spoke, almost bragging over his victory already. "Will you give me one moment of privacy, please?" Sherlock asked. "Of course." Moriarty responded quickly, and got up from his spot. There was a long silence at that point, before Sherlock began to laugh. Moriarty stopped walking away, and turned to sherlock quickly. "What??" What is it??" Sherlock continued to laugh, then grew quiet as he turned to moriarty. "What did I miss?" Jim yelled to him. "Your not going to do it? So the killers can be called off then, theres a recall code, or a word, or a number." There was a long silence. Moriarty hadnt meant to let that little piece of information go. "I dont have to die..." He paused, and picked up again ina. sing-songy voice, mocking moriarty. "If I've got you"
"Oh." Moriarty responded. "You think you can make me stop the order? You think you can make me do that?" He almost laughed. "Yes. So do you." He mocked his previous predator prey like circling. "Sherlock your big brother and all the kings horses couldnt make me do a thing i didnt want to." Sherlock stopped, and got close the Jim's face. "Yes, but im not my brother, remember? I am you. Prepared to do anything. Prepared to burn. Prepared to do what ordinary people wont do." Sherlock looks him dead in the eyes, a threatening, cold, stare. "You want me to shake hands with you in hell? I shall not disappoint you." He threatened. Moriarty started up again, by shaking his head slightly in dissagreement. "Nah. You talk big. Nah. Your ordinary. You're on the side of the angels." "Oh i may be on the side of the angels, but dont think for one second that i am one of them." He remarked. "No, your not." He paused, whilst Sherlock seemed to lighten a bit. "You're not ordinary, no. You're me." He laughed at him "You're me." He repeated, getting closer to his face. "Thank you, Sherlock Holmes." He reached out his hand for Sherlock to shake. "Thank you. Bless you. As long as im alive, you can save tour friends. You've got a way out." He looked away as he said this, then snapped his cold star back to Sherlock. "Well good luck with that." Suddenly a door swung open. It was john, and he held his gun tight, aimed straight for Moriarty. Interested in the situation, he stopped reaching for his gun. "Dont. Move." John spoke, quickly yet angrily. "But what if I wanted to get in on this too?" Moriarty asked, mocking the two. He pulled out his gun, aimed straight for john. Sherlock lunged at him, just as the trigger was pulled, saving john and knocking both the gun and Moriarty to the ground, Yet still keeping his footing on the ground. He turned to John. "Are you alright?" Sherlock asked, with genuine worry for his friend. "Oh god... Sherlock." John stuttered. "What? Whats wrong" Sherlock felt a sharp stinging pain in his side, as a dark red liquid began seeping through his shirt. He stumbled in his place, and his vision grew blurry. He suddenly saw John sprinting towards him, and then nothing.
